ROVI,London,4.3,I think the bar at ROVI provided a bit of privacy and acoustic kindness. I'd probably sit there again.
ROVI,London,4.3,"Staff were great. Helpful without being overbearing. Food was delicious and surprising, living up to expectations All four of us were delighted by the experience of eating here"
ROVI,London,4.3,"I’ve always appreciated this restaurant for its warmth and knowledgeable staff. Lately, though, the experience has become more transactional—focusing on upselling rather than guiding with care. The wine pairings feel less thoughtful, and the ambiance has grown robotic rather than inviting. It’s disappointing to see what it has become, and we won’t be back. I hope they rediscover the hospitality that once made it special."
ROVI,London,4.3,"Fabulous tasty and different food. The service is fantastic, you can try a sample of wines before buying a bottle and the team were very patient with us when we stayed much longer at our table than most. Highly recommended."
ROVI,London,4.3,"I really wanted to love Rovi and went on our anniversary! I’m a fan of Otto’s recipes and chose the restaurant myself as I love vegetarian food. BUT…as one who has a coriander allergy it was impossible to eat at the restaurant. The waitress took the menu from me, and after speaking with the chef, she came back with the menu with everything crossed out except one meat dish (I don’t eat meat!) , burrata and hummus with pita. Rather than leaving as it was a weekend (and our anniversary), we stayed. I was disheartened and surprised that the chef couldn’t prepare one fish or chicken dish without a sauce/marinade as a solution. Seems to me at such a high end restaurant a chef should be able to accommodate allergies with some sort of creative solution. After looking so forward to this meal, I was beyond disappointed."
ROVI,London,4.3,Fabulous food and so very creative. A bit on the high side in terms of price. Drinks were delicious and service was good..
ROVI,London,4.3,"Great experience! Discovering Ottolenghi’s cuisine was a revelation, an extraordinary and natural taste, a meticulous attention and respectful of flavors and textures, this is how dishes are born composed of simple ingredients but treated with extreme care and with great intelligence. Absolutely worth trying!"
ROVI,London,4.3,"As always the food was different and absolutely delicious. Excellent service too.
It is a real pleasure to have a meal at Rovi. Thank you very much."
ROVI,London,4.3,"We went to Yotam Ottolenghi's restaurant NOPI and loved it. We promptly asked them to make a reservation for us at one of the others nearby, ROVI. Ottolenghi is known in the USA through his cookbooks. Although we aren't vegetarians, we wanted to try his vegetable dishes, which have lots of texture and flavor. It didn't disappoint... there was a roasted celeriac root dish that was magnificent--we will be roasting celeraic for the rest of our lives! The staff was very attentive and friendly at both restaurants. The cocktails at ROVI and NOPI were imaginative and fun. The vibe at both restaurants was hip and lively, not stodgy."
ROVI,London,4.3,The food is overpriced. The service changed several times during the evening. Waiters were overwhelmed. We waited over an hour for dinner. Just a little apology after we made the complaint. We expected more from one of Yotam Ottolenghi. Quality has declined since the last visit in winter 2024. Too bad
ROVI,London,4.3,"Everything is right, interior, staff, food provided a lunch ‘to remember’b Atmospheric, friendly and great tastes. 

Ottolenghi et al.'s cuisine is the best!"
ROVI,London,4.3,"We had a lovely evening at Rovi. The wait staff, the food and ambience was fantastic. We enjoyed sitting at the bar and saw the action and engaged with the staff. We selected the Chef’s menu which gave us an array of amazing dishes. The crispy aubergine tops, pesto pasta was flavorful, grilled shrimp and their signature dish, celeriac shawarma were delicious. Every dish came with a unique and flavorful taste."
ROVI,London,4.3,"We were invited by friends to lunch to celebrate my husbands birthday. What great friends we have! delicious food, excellent service by exceptional people and lovely ambiance. I’ve always been a huge fan of Ottolenghi, the restaurants and cafes never disappoint."
ROVI,London,4.3,Wow wow wow!!!! An unbelievable experience! If you visit London this is a must!!! Yotam Ottolenghi has left Rovi in the more than capable hands of head chef Andy Frantzeskos and boy what a food journey this was!! Andy is sooooo passionate about the food he is serving ! My taste buds were pinging all over the place! Normally meat is top of my list but Andy’s vegetarian and fish dishes were exquisite! I can hand on heart say this was my favourite lunch ever!!!!!😋😋😋😋 it did help that I had my best friend with me my son Joe!❤️❤️ hats off to you Andy! What a chef what a host. We will be back!!!!
ROVI,London,4.3,"We dined as a couple in what we understand to be not long reopened Rovi further to a refurb & were very impressed with the atmosphere, decor, the very tasty dishes we chose and all the staff, who couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful - nothing was too much trouble, even accommodating us when we turned up earlier than planned. Alex & Jacob, in particular, were great from start to finish, with Alex guiding us through the menu and sharing his recommendations & helping us pick the right number of dishes, as we wanted to try them all! The dishes were a taste sensation and definitely celebrate vegetables from root to tip. If all vegetables tasted like this, I don't think I would miss eating meat. Particular favourites were the crispy aubergine tops, celeriac shawarma & the burrata."
ROVI,London,4.3,Loved the vibe of this restaurant. We booked it as we were looking for an exclusively gluten-free meal and they were very accomodating. Everything we had was absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend.

ROVI,London,4.3,"This sophisticated and sociable slice of Central London is a shopper’s paradise, offering the latest fashions, gadgets, and souvenirs. Fitzrovia is conveniently located between the major retail thoroughfares of Regent Street to the west and Tottenham Court Road to the east, with a handful of well connected Tube stations dotted around the area for easy transport. This neighborhood is a favorite among foodies as well, with an impressive number of quality restaurants, pubs, cafes and food shops vying for your patronage – especially along Charlotte Street and near Goodge Street Station."

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Fantastic place. We went there for a beer so we didn't eat anything. The bartender, Anselmo, stra helpful: he made us try the different beers of the house before making us order then recommended places not to be missed in the city. What about: the right man at the right time! 

If you have just arrived in London, want a beer and need to settle in a little, this is the place for you!"

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Eaten two salads and a simple burger, exaggerated cost even if you are in London.....89 pounds a steal.
Good food but overpriced and location in the basement."
Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Hi Laura,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We’re pleased to hear that you enjoyed the food, though we’re sorry to learn that you felt the prices did not meet your expectations.

As a centrally located venue in London and part of an international brand, our pricing reflects our location, operating costs, and the overall experience we aim to offer, all of which are clearly displayed on our menu before ordering. While we understand that value is subjective, we strive to deliver quality ingredients, generous portions, and a unique atmosphere alongside our food.

We appreciate your comments and will be sure to share them with the team. Thank you again for visiting and for sharing your perspective."

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"I love this branch of the Hard Rock Cafe. I love eating here and we always have a good time when we are here. Today we went to the shop. The shop is so cool, it is the biggest Rock Shop in Europe. The clothes are so cool and have great designs. There is a wide variety of things to buy here. The decor of the shop area is so cool. What’s really brilliant is that there is a facility available to book an Uber, Theatre Tickets and London Attractions. The shop is worth checking out. Hard Rock Cafe Piccadilly is close to Piccadilly Circus station."

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"This Hard Rock is practically close to the tube station, in the heart of London's nightlife. The upper floor is used as a merchandising while the lower floor is the restaurant. Very good food quality and impeccable service and extremely available. In my case, after spilling a glass of coke, still not even tasted, they immediately cleaned everything up and even offered the new coke. Clean and well organized. Highly recommended"

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Terrible experience we ordered a few starters to share and a cocktail, only to be told once food arrived we couldn't order any more cocktails due to it not being a main meal. Due licensing! Should have been mentioned at the start, complete waste of money! Such a shame too as all other hard rocks have been fab! Wouldn't return as we had high hopes 👎"
Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Hi there,

Thank you for the review and feedback. I do understand your frustration but as our liquor license from Westminster Council specifically dictates that there is a substantial meal associated with an alcoholic beverage hence the team has mentioned it to your table and offered to be moved into the bar area where licensing restriction doesn't require such. We do ask our guest if they are for dining or just drink and a snack which you will be directed to the bar area if available at that time."

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Perennially fashionable since the days of Henry VIII, the aristocratic “Clubland” of St James's is a premier destination for high end craft and bespoke design. Here you’ll lose count of the Royal Warrants (which indicate that the Royal Family patronizes the establishment) seen in shop front windows, even during a short stroll to bordering Green Park or St James’s Park. With the brightly lit and constantly buzzing junction of Piccadilly Circus at its northeast corner and none of Central London too far away, this is an surprisingly central and accessible part of town, especially given its prosperous demeanor."

The Barbary,London,4.6,"A very nice place, with traditional Lebanese cuisine. Naan bred and black falafel are delicious; had never tried hummus tatbila before, and I found it absolutely tasty . You sit close together around one long shared table"
The Barbary,London,4.6,"We had an amazing experience at The Barbary! Sitting at the bar was perfect, you could watch the chefs at work and see their attention to detail and skill up close. The food was flavorful, creative, and beautifully presented. Definitely a spot I’d recommend to anyone who loves good food and a lively atmosphere."
The Barbary,London,4.6,"Excellent restaurant! If you can get a reservation, do it. We came for lunch and had a wonderful experience. Probably the best food we ate during our trip to London. It’s a small 24 seat counter restaurant. The staff walks you through the menu and gives advice . Everything is meant to be shared. Most dishes are cooked on an open fire grill in the center of counter for all to see. The vibe is cool and the food is delicious. I Highly recommend."
The Barbary,London,4.6,"Off the Chart! The Barbary did not disappoint. Food, service and ambience all amazing. Intimate, fun, great staff. A perfect date venue. And the food? Wow. The spinach, feta and yoghurt dip with nan is a must. The lamb is mouth watering. Octopus and pumpkin seeds? Can I have some more please. Nothing disappointed. Everything excelled. We were left scratching our heads if we had actually ever had a better meal anywhere (and that includes London, Paris, NY and we like to dine). The Barbary is a must. Thanks team. You are talented, welcoming and have created something very very special. We will be back very soon."
The Barbary,London,4.6,We came here to celebrate our 40th anniversary ( our son recommended the restaurant). Everyone sits at the bar which is kind of a horseshoe shape with the kitchen in the middle. Seating is a bit tight- we were greeted enthusiastically and began the process of ordering eating etc. the food was very delicious and the atmosphere was very fun. Book a table- highly recommended.
The Barbary,London,4.6,"This is my personal beat meal I have had for 2025, where do I start, the atmosphere is amazing, then the service followed by the food 

Jane was truly so fabulous with helping us choose this amazing food

Been to many London Restaurants and for me is the best"
The Barbary,London,4.6,"What a fantastic find! We stumbled upon The Barbary while exploring the area and thought it looked interesting, so booked for lunch a few days later. An awesome experience! The restaurant is small, and tight! But.. that almost added to the experience! We were sat at the counter and watched the amazing team create their magic. Service was perfect, professional, enthusiastic and could not be faulted. The menu consists of a typical “sharing” concept. We stared with incredible naan cooked as we watched. Humous and labneh were so fresh and bright. Their signature “cigar” starter was hot, fresh and so flavorful with a yogurt/mint sauce. We then had the salmon and lamb, both were outstanding… the salmon was pink and perfect, as was the lamb! Again incredible flavors and presentation. We added the chili cauliflower and that also was a nice combo, adding another texture to the meal. Bottle of Tempranillo, house wine but certainly decent, and we live in Spain! All in all a fantastic lunch, we cant wait to return on our next London visit."
The Barbary,London,4.6,"The food was outstanding - imaginative, well prepared and well presented, if frankly expensive. The staff behind the counter were equally welcoming, attentive and interested in providing excellence in dining.

The maitre d’ however made it clear that the sole purpose of the restaurant was to extract as much money as possible in as short a period of time as possible.

We were 10 minutes over our allotted 1:30 booking, with three free seats at the bar, when we were told that either we preferred something else or we should leave - this after having requested the bill from another team member.

I get it, they need to make money. It just won’t be from me in future.

Thanks, but I won’t be tricking you again."
The Barbary,London,4.6,"How wonderful, everything perfect, the concept, the place. The food and the music. A mix of flavors and cultures in the dishes and in the team on this side and beyond the counter around which you eat. A group of young and very talented boys who put their different origins in the inspiration and flavors of dishes with Israeli, Arab, Lebanese influences and so on. Every dish with a tapas concept to share is a journey and a discovery. You guys deserve the success you're getting and all the best. Thank you for the wonderful experience it will be an honor and a pleasure to return to visit you"
The Barbary,London,4.6,"Wonderful experience! Friendly and professional staff. Blackened salmon was perfectly prepared, coffee rubbed chicken was moist and crunchy, “cigars” great with the dip and the man was perfect. Wonderful atmosphere with the open kitchen and great music selections. Just great."
The Barbary,London,4.6,"Lovely relaxed atmosphere with soft music in background. Tables are a bit too close . Service is fast yet not pushy or business like. Food I tried was perfectly cooked, right balance of flavours. Portions on the smallish sides"
The Barbary,London,4.6,"North African / Middle Eastern food made in front of you with live fire. This fun little gem in Neal's Yard is mainly all bar, so you can watch the food being made in front of you. It was hard to pick what I wanted to eat, as everything on the menu looked amazing. It did not disappoint. The Bavette Steak with Chermoula had me craving for more!"
The Barbary,London,4.6,"From the moment we walked into The Barbary we knew we would have an amazing night. The music was such fun, staff were so friendly and the restaurant was so chic. Alex looked after us and talked through the menu, making sure my intolerances were catered for. Merci Alex! 
The counter tables are fantastic and so cool to watch the chefs at work. Really recommend everything we ate; the naan, cods roe, hummus, cigars, sea bream and pork. The wine list was so unique too! Really fantastic evening, thank you!"
The Barbary,London,4.6,"A chance last day delight - the best meal with the best service in our entire 3 week UK visit. The food was fantastic and what could be better than sitting looking into the kitchen, literally right in front of us, where the delightful chefs shared their expertise. Every dish was richly flavored, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. I wish it was not our very last day - I’d be back in a shot."
The Barbary,London,4.6,"We went for lunch here and were really impressed, the food was incredible. We started with a selection of dips with the hummus being a particular favourite and then moved onto the mains with our favourites being the lamb and the octopus though everything was delicious. Finally desserts to finish with the hashcake (sort of a pistachio tart) being the standout. Service was friendly and helpful too, talking through the dishes and giving recommendations and we never felt rushed at all. My only tip though is booking as it can be hard to get a table (and having eaten there, I see why!)."

The Barbary,London,4.6,"Whether you're headed here to check out the multitude of shops, theaters, cafes, pubs, and restaurants, or simply to be among the multitude of people who pass through this pretty part of town, you'll love soaking up the festive and historic atmosphere in and around Covent Garden. Even if you don't have tickets to the opera or a show at one of the many famous theaters here, don't be surprised if find yourself captivated by some impromptu act of a street performer wowing the crowds in Covent Garden's Piazza. If you do have tickets, you'll be pleased to note that many of the local eateries accommodate theatergoers with prix fixe menus, early dinners, and later than usual opening hours."

The Prince of Wales,London,4.8,The Sunday roast dinner was amazing! We had the chicken roast and everything was delicious. We also had the crumble with custard for dessert and it was great too.

The Prince of Wales,London,4.8,"The Prince of Wales is conveniently located near my hotel. After a long day of travel, I was looking f forward to a pint and a nice lunch.

The Prince of Wales,London,4.8,"We went to Prince of Wales for the Sunday roast after a day of museum hopping. What a pleasure to sit in the bar and eat such a delicious beef roast with all the trimmings. The owner, we think... Tom? Welcomed us. There was a birthday going on in the corner table and two couples in a banquette. Such a charming atmosphere. By the time we left we had shared our sticky toffee pudding and were offered a sluce of birthday cake. 
We went back for lunch another say and the fish and chips were delicious and Sheila a lovely, attentive server. 
We will be back! A call out to the nice lady in the kitchen. Thank you from Southern California."

"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"This is a classy restaurant with great service, great food and great views. The team are really attentive and unobstructive and take great care with special requirements."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"We haven’t been here for a while, but it is still being exactly what you want from a good restaurant.
We came for lunch and the menu was delightfully short, but with plenty of choice. The crab on a potato waffle was delicious, and the stracciatella with poached pears was a really wonderful surprise. One of us had a most tender and nicely cooked fillet of beef with mushrooms and the Shetland halibut was amazing. 
Paired with an excellent wine and a small digestif, we left comfortably full and very relaxed.
Service was kind and friendly. This isn’t a place to come to if you’re on a budget, but if you want to splash out, it is worth the money in our view."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"A simply extraordinary dining experience at London’s OXO Restaurant, where elegance, technique and sensitivity coexist in perfect balance.
Each dish tells a story made of excellent raw materials, great aesthetic care and impeccable room service: attentive, discreet and always smiling.

Special applause goes to the Scottish Langoustine dish, carrot, ginger, shellfish aioli, which literally left me speechless. I only tasted a few bites off my girlfriend's plate, and I was astonished.

A dish of great style and precision, where the following coexist harmoniously:

Elegant carrot sweetness

Spicy aromatic ginger, never intrusive

Intense and clean sea depth of langoustine

Controlled and enveloping fatness of shellfish aioli

A rare, refined, memorable balance.

Precisely because of the emotion that this dish gave me, I allow myself a curiosity as a great enthusiast:
I would love to be able to recreate it for my girlfriend one day. Would it be possible to know, even if only in outline, the recipe or philosophy of the dish?
In particular, I would like to know if inside the zucchini cannolo there are only scampi or even other fish or crustaceans, and what is the meaning and technique of the yellow lines on the zucchini, which are very intriguing both from an aesthetic and taste point of view. A more in-depth description would really be a gift.

Definitely I will be back, and will definitely recommend this restaurant to all my friends who will come to London: OXO is a must for those who love great cuisine.

Sincere congratulations to the kitchen and the service of the room.
Thank you very much for this beautiful dining experience, which I will carry with me for a long time."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"Great atmosphere , good food and friendly staff. Easy location to find with a great view………………………….amazing cocktails."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"Lovely pre theatre dinner. Took advantage of the 3 courses and glass of prosecco for £35. Excellent value even with the dishes and wine we added on. Lovely attentive service, didn't feel at all rushed.
Having read negative reviews about the temperature of the space we were slightly concerned but needn't have been, in fact was on the very warm side.
Food excellent 😁 and portions large (couldn't finish dessert).
Great."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"If you're going to eat here, you should definitely bring blankets. With an outside temperature of 1 degree, it is not more than 15 degrees inside. In addition, a fresh wind blows from the air conditioning, which quickly makes the good food cold. At a price of £560 for four people, the explanation of the service doesn't help either that there's a lot of glass around and that's why it's so cold.... Well, we're not coming back... maybe in the summer"
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"I was with my family for dinner, unrefined environment with New Year's Eve arrangements from paese.Personale unkind and a menu with prices absolutely out of the norm compared to what is proposed on the plate.
To ask for certain prices you have to have a chef in the kitchen who is able to cook in a certain way and in the room of kind people.
I absolutely do not recommend this place, the view is beautiful but not enough.
I felt fooled."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"Lovely food, great service, relaxed. Reassuringly excellent comms beforehand. 

Everything about our visit was excellent and hit just the right note for a post-graduation celebration meal. 

We were asked beforehand if it was a special occasion and my daughter felt very special that she was greeted with congratulations at reception. The dessert option with a message piped on rounded things off perfectly.

Every single person we encountered, from outside the lift arriving to when we left, was friendly, courteous and really excellent at what they were doing. A super standard of food. We were really grateful for the window seating, which we had not requested and was a real bonus in making our daughter’s day memorable. As the Principal at her graduation said to them all, “we don’t know your whole stories and what it took for you to make it through to now, but we see you.” Our daughter deserved her day, and our time in the brasserie added perfectly to it."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"Lovely view, friendly vibe, attentive helpful staff and gorgeous food!!
Fish and sea food tasty and fresh.
Will definitely revisit!"
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"The service was great, well catered for and checked upon frequently but not often enough to be annoying.
We went for Afternoon Tea. The menu was as expected and the Salmon (my weakness) was perfect.
The tea selection was large but the options were very similar.
Scenery was ideal as we watched the contrast from a bright day to night views (3pm to 5pm).
A bit pricey and would have rather been asked to donate to charity rather than it be included on the bill without any forewarning. 
The Xmas crackers at £3.75ea (inc a donation) were VERY basic, not something I would associate with Harvey Nichols, more Poundland.
Overall, a nice experience for me and my partner."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"One of our favourite restaurants in London and we booked for our Christmas meal with close friends. Unfortunately we were surprised at the greatly increased prices compared with our last visit a few months ago. Seems they were exploiting Christmas time. The service was excellent as usual but our meals were only average For example, my friend and I chose halibut which came with a few vegetables was £49 excluding sides. The piece of fish was very small and virtually tasteless. A great disappointment. Perhaps the word had got around because for a Friday night close to Christmas the restaurant was less than half full"
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"Probably the best view of St Paul's Cathedral from anywhere, but it isn't worth the price. Starters all cost more than £20 - for two scallops? - and £46 for a piece of under-seasoned halibut not much bigger than my thumb, sitting in an insipid green sauce. 

All this is probably reflected in the place being half empty on the Friday before Christmas. It's a pity because we've eaten well there previously and the location is great. Service was good. The room was cold, I'm not sure whether this was due to aircon too high or heating too low."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"It’s been a few years since I was here and I had been many times before that. The crab starter on a potato waffle was dire. The waffle was more like a stale reheated spongecake. The main dish of Pork was lukewarm as if it had been cooked on a radiator. The crushed potatoes were unremarkable and also cold, the cauliflower arrived 5 mins after we started eating and guess what? Was stone cold but it was taken off the bill. Staff are super lovely, but the service was far too quick, I think we’d had both courses in 45 mins."
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"Just wanted to say thank you for yesterday – really appreciate all the support and everyone being so accommodating.

The dinner was lovely and the team really enjoyed it!"
"OXO Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie",London,4.3,"Our afternoon tea was superb, including the offer of a glass of champagne. We tried hard to resist but two seconds later we said “Yes!”
The service was excellent and the staff very helpful in terms of our onward journey."

Padella,London,4.3,"Great fresh pasta restaurant
It’s delicious 
The staff is very friendly
Only downside is the noise with the world and the music"
Padella,London,4.3,"We asked what dishes were vegetarian on arriving and the waiter was very helpful and ticked all that applied, as it isn’t listed on the menu. When we came to ordering, he asked us if we wanted extra parmesan. 

With parmesan generally not vegetarian, we were surprised by the question so enquired. His response was “well, it’s personal preference as to whether you consider it vegetarian or not. But it contains animal rennet. We don’t consider it non-vegetarian here”. 

Seems so strange to me that a restaurant like this is passing off parmesan with animal rennet in it as vegetarian, but this is really poor and an exceptional lack of awareness and training. And then turned out that some of the dishes that had been indicated to us on the menu as vegetarian, such as the pumpkin ravioli, had parmesan within it. 

Having changed our order, the food we did get to me was overrated compared to what I expected. The pasta dishes are small and the only standout was the chilli pasta - the cacio e pepe was disappointing, as was the cavolo nero dish which was bland. Wouldn’t return."
Padella,London,4.3,"Ciao sbrady123, I hope you are doing well.
Thanks for taking time to give us your feedback, and I’m sorry you didn’t find your experience as good as your expectations.
This is definitely not the way we like to take care of our customers, giving the “wrong” information or not being specific when it comes to food requirement.
I would like to investigate better about your visit to our restaurant and having a proper chat with my staff.
Please reach out to my email for that: francesco.c@padella.co
I wish you a good weekend.
Francesco."
Padella,London,4.3,"Net of the discomfort resulting from the fact that they do not accept reservations and then you have to mark yourself at the entrance and wait (for a good hour) for the table to clear, anyone who was catapulted by Pan blindfolded, would think they were in Italy... Italian cuisine is of a very high level, fresh pasta that resembles those made by mom, tasty sauces, but delicate. The top is value for money, well above the London average. In our living room, we had such a good time, that we had dinner twice. For Italians in London who are abstinent from flour and eggs, this is the place!"
Padella,London,4.3,Lunch at borough market restaurant. Very good homemade pasta and very friendly staff. I recommend for a quick lunch
Padella,London,4.3,"padella was an experience by self . 

great pastas, freshly made from scratch in front of you, a must visit restaurant in london"
Padella,London,4.3,"My friend and I had a pre-Christmas lunch in the Shoreditch Padella. The staff were so lovely and attentive with ordering and bringing water. The food was delicious we both had the Dorset crab pasta with a glass of wine and then shared a lemon tart which was amazing and so velvety. The portion sizes were perfect. The restaurant had a great vibe and was busy, I was glad I booked. Would definitely recommend."
Padella,London,4.3,I loved every bit of my food at padella. Freshly made in front of you with fresh ingredients. A experience unique from rest . A must visit in london
Padella,London,4.3,A very tiny restaurant and you use a QR code to get a table. It’s worth the effort as the food and service is amazing. Highly recommended
Padella,London,4.3,"Beautiful Food - 100% worth a visit!

We came across this place while we were in London trying to find somewhere near to where we are staying. There is a virtual queue to go in which to me is a good sign. We got a text when our table was ready and were served by a really lovely waitress who was friendly and informative. We had gorgeous starters and pasta mains which were both very very good and just the right amount.

I would say this place is a must when you are in the area and not expensive either! We shall return!!"
Padella,London,4.3,"Another tuck-your-elbows-in spot and we loved it. It’s a lively and tight space serving some great food. The menu offers a great selection of handmade pastas, with as well antipasti, puddings and digestivi to choose from. We kicked things off with the Nocellara olives and radicchio salad then moved onto Pici cacio e pepe and the Pappardelle with 8-hour Dexter beef shin ragù. Everything was wonderful!

Anticipate a queue, we did not and waited a while outside with others."
Padella,London,4.3,"Never disappoints- service always great, food is vv good and prices have remained impressively reasonable. Waiters are super friendly and accommodating, atmosphere is always buzzing. Portions are good and the pasta is excellent quality. Also a big fan of the reservation system which allows turning up an hour before eating and strolling along southbank until your table is ready. Will always keep coming back here. Recommend the ragú and the tagliolini, do not skip the tiramisu."
Padella,London,4.3,"Great food, friendly service, just a really nice little place for a good catch up with a friend. They don't take bookings but have a virtual queuing system you can join, so you don't have to stand for a long time waiting outside."
Padella,London,4.3,"Great food, great staff, wasntt so keen on my wine choice..but restaurant all in all great"
Padella,London,4.3,"Got a table last minute and it was worth it. Food was delish, 10 out of 10. Spend money on the food because its teally good. Went for the cheapest wine, thought it was pricey and it was ok"
Padella,London,4.3,"Nice and informal location near Borough Market, very convenient because we did not wait in line but they recorded us and called us with a text message when the table was freed! 
The pasta is excellent as in Italy, special cheese and pepper! We were greeted by Francesco super nice and sympathetic who advised us and even offered coffee!"
Padella,London,4.3,"Book in and join a virtual queue. It said 60 mins but it was only about 30 to 40 before we were messaged, and seated. There are very few tables. Most seating is on stools either around the kitchen, or the window. We were seated looking into the kitchen. It was fascinating watching the food being prepared. Everyone doing their job so quickly and proficiently. We all had different pasta dishes, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed what they had. The food was well presented and delicious. The staff were very friendly and helpful, explaining patiently when we were unsure what a dish contained."

Padella,London,4.3,"Even before the arrival of the instantly iconic Shard, the riverside scene in Southwark had moved well beyond any up-and-coming phase of development. For quite some time, locals and out-of-towners alike have loved browsing the boutiques of Bermondsey High Street, foraging through the bounteous stalls at centuries old foodie haven Borough Market, and flocking to the banks of the Thames to enjoy some of Britain's biggest attractions such as Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe. Despite Southwark's many popular draws, instant calm can be achieved easily by turning down almost any side street. For more urban buzz, a quick stroll across famed bridges like the pedestrianized Millennium Bridge or the ever photogenic Tower Bridge yields access to the very core of Central London. And with London Bridge Station as this neighborhood's main transportation hub, getting across town (or to anywhere in England for that matter) is a relative breeze."

The truffled mac & cheese is also a savoury delight. The staff were very attentive and kind. The atmosphere here is cosy and inviting. It’s easy to stay here for a couple of rounds more than you planned for. I’d also like to give a special shout out to Jim for parking our stroller inside and taking good care of our toddler."

Buckingham Arms,London,4.6,"We were here on the 3rd. Evening of our trip. After the two first evenings were rather an expensive disappointment, it was a very nice evening at Buckingham Arms! 
Even the nice welcome and the service by the very dedicated host was a pleasure. Ordering and paying later was also much easier than usual in the pub. In addition to the many beers on tap, there is a small but fine selection of wines. My wife said the burger was the best she ever had. Even better than in France. And I was very lucky that it was Sunday. I had heard of the Sunday Roast many times, but it exceeded all my expectations, tender, juicy and to the point. A Sunday evening in this pub we can only recommend."
Buckingham Arms,London,4.6,"Hello there, 
Ein so tolles britisches Pub – das freut uns riesig! Wir profitieren sehr von unserer Lage direkt neben dem Buckingham Palace, die uns die Möglichkeit gibt, nette Menschen aus aller Welt kennenzulernen, so wie Sie.

Aga & Team Buckingham Arms"

Buckingham Arms,London,4.6,"If you only had an afternoon to experience London on a grand scale, Westminster would be a wise place to start. The ornate Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey sit adjacent at a corner of Parliament Square, and a short stroll along The Mall leads to Buckingham Palace. Trafalgar Square and Nelson's Column are just up the road as well. As captivating as the architecture is, the wonders of Mother Nature are highlights of the area too. St James's Park (arguably London's loveliest), the expansive Green Park, and pedestrian friendly tree lined paths along the river showcase the exquisite manicure provided by English gardeners. Just beyond the landmarks and the gorgeous outdoor spaces, quiet residential squares and age old local pubs offer a more subdued take on this global seat of power in the heart of London."

Dobar,London,4.9,"Have to say this place has up the levels since i last came with new dishes on the menu which unfortunately i dodnt get a chance to try.

 I brought my friend to try out the breakfast OMG dish and the other dish with the french toast it was absolutely amazing, the decor, the atmosphere was very relaxing a good place to chill and catch up whilst indulging in great food. 

The pictures on their website match exactly as you see it in reality. There's a free parking area 5 mins down the road for 2 hrs or right opposite manor house station. 

 Zena was a great hostess and was very helpful telling is about the history of the shop and what are the go too dishes. Would definitely recommend to try it out, big upgrade on your normal cafe would be very silly not to try this place out."
Dobar,London,4.9,"The food, drinks, service & atmosphere were all 12/10. Easily one of the best breakfasts in London, such attention to detail. zena served us and was so friendly and kind. We will def be back"
Dobar,London,4.9,"We had a really nice experience...
The English breakfast was unexpected WAW 🤩 I recommended for everybody (specially french people) .
We had really good advices from Zeyno for the brunch ✨️"
Dobar,London,4.9,"Very friendly service. 
Cozy place to have breakfast. 
Dish, land and sea was very nicely presented and very tasty. More than enough. 
Definitely recommended."
Dobar,London,4.9,"This is my third time going to Dobar when I travel England London with my family. This time we went on Sunday at 12.00 midday. There was a little bit of a queue but I know from previous visits that it was worth the wait ( which wasn't more than 5/10 mins). The staff are so happy and friendly and apologized for the wait but sat us and served us very speedily. The service is fast, not rushed although they know more people are waiting outside. The food is amazing and I mean it when I say that it is the best brunch I have ever had anywhere, for that reason I go back even though this time we was in a hotel on the other side of London. It will always be my go to place on my visits to London if they keep up with this quality and service. Thanks. I will dream of your brunches until next time I can visit."
Dobar,London,4.9,"First time at Dobar and I would definitely return. The staff are warm and courteous. The food came moments after ordering, so no long wait. The environment is cosy. Not loud. You can have a good conversation while you're there. An added plus is that it is literally a step from the Manor House Station."

Alexander The Great,London,4.8,"With a number of restaurants in the area serving similar cuisine, the fact that this one is always busy & often full, says everything you need to know. 

Although the dining area is small the intimate atmosphere is pleasant. The food is freshly prepared, cooked perfectly, presented with thought & served professionally. CONGRATULATIONS to the management for the quality & consistency. 

Due to the popularity you MUST book beforehand to ensure you have a table. 

Will definitely return in the very near future."

This latest visit was a very very busy Saturday evening but the service and food was 100%. The family who run it and staff are so friendly, attentive and kind. 
4 people in our party shared the meze and the amount of food we got actually beat us, we had to take some of our meat course home in a takeaway box.
This lovley authentic no frills Greek restaurant is without boubt the best we have visited outside Grecce and even if you have to wait a few minutes to get a table, is well worth the wait, you will not be disappointed."

Alexander The Great,London,4.8,"Famous for its sprawling cluster of markets and shops as well as for an embrace of all things counter culture, Camden offers a concentrated version of London street life. From bargain shopping and people watching to rubbing elbows in its abundance of pubs and bars, Camden is the place to be for many a Londoner. It is also home to some of the hottest live music venues in Europe. As packed as Camden High Street and its tributaries can get during the weekends, this neighborhood is right next to some of the city's most beloved outdoor spaces, namely Regent's Park and Primrose Hill."

Good food but overpriced and location in the basement."
Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Hi Laura,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We’re pleased to hear that you enjoyed the food, though we’re sorry to learn that you felt the prices did not meet your expectations.

We appreciate your comments and will be sure to share them with the team. Thank you again for visiting and for sharing your perspective."

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"I love this branch of the Hard Rock Cafe. I love eating here and we always have a good time when we are here. Today we went to the shop. The shop is so cool, it is the biggest Rock Shop in Europe. The clothes are so cool and have great designs. There is a wide variety of things to buy here. The decor of the shop area is so cool. What’s really brilliant is that there is a facility available to book an Uber, Theatre Tickets and London Attractions. The shop is worth checking out. Hard Rock Cafe Piccadilly is close to Piccadilly Circus station."

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"This Hard Rock is practically close to the tube station, in the heart of London's nightlife. The upper floor is used as a merchandising while the lower floor is the restaurant. Very good food quality and impeccable service and extremely available. In my case, after spilling a glass of coke, still not even tasted, they immediately cleaned everything up and even offered the new coke. Clean and well organized. Highly recommended"

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Terrible experience we ordered a few starters to share and a cocktail, only to be told once food arrived we couldn't order any more cocktails due to it not being a main meal. Due licensing! Should have been mentioned at the start, complete waste of money! Such a shame too as all other hard rocks have been fab! Wouldn't return as we had high hopes 👎"
Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Hi there,

Thank you for the review and feedback. I do understand your frustration but as our liquor license from Westminster Council specifically dictates that there is a substantial meal associated with an alcoholic beverage hence the team has mentioned it to your table and offered to be moved into the bar area where licensing restriction doesn't require such. We do ask our guest if they are for dining or just drink and a snack which you will be directed to the bar area if available at that time."

Hard Rock Cafe London Piccadilly Circus,London,4.8,"Perennially fashionable since the days of Henry VIII, the aristocratic “Clubland” of St James's is a premier destination for high end craft and bespoke design. Here you’ll lose count of the Royal Warrants (which indicate that the Royal Family patronizes the establishment) seen in shop front windows, even during a short stroll to bordering Green Park or St James’s Park. With the brightly lit and constantly buzzing junction of Piccadilly Circus at its northeast corner and none of Central London too far away, this is an surprisingly central and accessible part of town, especially given its prosperous demeanor."

Maroto Restaurant,London,5.0,"Tripadvisor is not responsible for this summary or the opinions in it. For more information, please read the traveler reviews and learn more about how the site works."
Maroto Restaurant,London,5.0,"Maroto is billed as a Brazilian-European fusion restaurant and is a lively spot just off Oxford Street.
The menu is mainly meat based, the lamb rack was excellent, but there are vegetarian and fish options and the cod/white feijao dish was perfect. The dessert list is short with the bomboca/coffee/baileys ice cream our favourite.
Although the cocktail list is strong the wine list could do with beefing up with a limited choice and it was a pity the Brazilian sparkling wine was no longer available.
Service was friendly and it is well worth a visit. At £65 for two courses and £75 for three as well as a £95 tasting menu be prepared to pay for the experience."
Maroto Restaurant,London,5.0,"The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was excellent everything was perfectly prepared and served with great care. A wonderful dining experience overall!"
Maroto Restaurant,London,5.0,"Amazing restaurant, very good service and food, warm atmosphere and a lovely setting. Perfect spot highly recommend it!!! We’ll definitely be coming back!"

Maroto Restaurant,London,5.0,"Maroto is honestly one of the nicest spots I’ve been to. The atmosphere is so cozy and welcoming, and it instantly makes you feel relaxed. The food is amazing—full of flavor, fresh, and really well cooked. There’s a good variety on the menu too, so there’s something for everyone. The staff are super friendly and helpful, which makes the whole experience even better. I love how everything feels easy and comfortable, whether you’re going with friends, family, or just grabbing a nice meal out. Overall, Maroto is the kind of place you’ll want to keep coming back to."
Maroto Restaurant,London,5.0,"I had an incredible experience dining at Maroto in Mayfair. From the moment I walked in, I was struck by the stylish yet welcoming atmosphere. The staff were attentive and made me feel genuinely cared for throughout the evening. The food was outstanding – beautifully presented and bursting with flavour. I loved how each main came with a variety of sauces, offering a perfect balance of tastes. My personal highlight was the tender pork belly, though the prawns and desserts were equally impressive. Everything felt refined without being pretentious. Maroto is truly a memorable restaurant that I can’t wait to revisit."

Tower Tandoori Restaurant,London,4.8,"Even before the arrival of the instantly iconic Shard, the riverside scene in Southwark had moved well beyond any up-and-coming phase of development. For quite some time, locals and out-of-towners alike have loved browsing the boutiques of Bermondsey High Street, foraging through the bounteous stalls at centuries old foodie haven Borough Market, and flocking to the banks of the Thames to enjoy some of Britain's biggest attractions such as Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe. Despite Southwark's many popular draws, instant calm can be achieved easily by turning down almost any side street. For more urban buzz, a quick stroll across famed bridges like the pedestrianized Millennium Bridge or the ever photogenic Tower Bridge yields access to the very core of Central London. And with London Bridge Station as this neighborhood's main transportation hub, getting across town (or to anywhere in England for that matter) is a relative breeze."

Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"Shanghai Family (大滬仁家) is one of the few places in London where you can taste truly authentic Shanghainese cuisine, and I’ve already gone back several times. The braised pork belly is rich but not greasy and literally melts in your mouth; the pan-fried soup dumplings have thin skins, crispy bottoms and plenty of broth; and the new claypot dishes come with a flavorful, comforting broth and generous ingredients (including egg dumplings, which instantly reminded me of home). The Mao Xue Wang has a well-balanced spicy and numbing kick without being overly oily, and pairs perfectly with rice. The restaurant is clean, dishes come out quickly, the average price is around £30 per person, and the location next to the British Museum is very convenient. If you’re craving genuine Shanghainese food in London, this place is absolutely worth trying."
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"Shanghai Family is a restaurant in London where you can get an authentic taste of Shanghai. I've had it many times. Red roast meat fat but not greasy, mouth instant, raw fried buns thin, crisp bottom, ample juice; new casserole series soup head fresh, rich ingredients (actually there are dumplings, people feel instantly home)"
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"This restaurant is definitely going on my list of Chinese places I’d happily return to. We ordered the sizzling spicy pork intestines, xiaolongbao, and scallion oil noodles, and every dish was spot on. The spicy intestines arrived in a fragrant pool of chili oil with a bold, layered numbing-spicy kick that wasn’t just harsh heat; the intestines were cleaned really well with virtually no off smell, and the texture was pleasantly chewy yet tender and incredibly flavorful. The xiaolongbao had thin skins that held up nicely, with plenty of savory broth and juicy, fresh filling that wasn’t greasy; a little vinegar made them even better, and we immediately wanted another basket. The scallion oil noodles looked simple but were deeply aromatic, with a balanced savory sauce and springy noodles that coated evenly in every bite. Overall, the flavors were authentic and the quality was consistent, satisfying, comforting, and highly recommended."
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"I like Family Feast Hot Pot best
The moment this pot arrived at the table, you just knew it was something special.
The prawns were incredibly fresh.
The handmade egg dumplings were a real highlight — one bite and it instantly brought back familiar, comforting flavors from home.
The meatballs were a pleasant surprise: fragrant, tender, and absolutely delicious.
Add to that the glass noodles and pork tripe, each soaked up the broth beautifully.
The soup base was rich yet not greasy, clean and deeply savory.
For a moment, it truly felt like being home again."
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"A lovely Chinese restaurant with authentic flavours and generous portions. The dishes were well-seasoned and clearly freshly prepared, especially the mains, which stood out for their depth of flavour. Service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive, and the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming. A great spot for both casual meals and small gatherings. Would happily return."
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"Solid Shanghainese food and very satisfying overall. The dishes were tasty, comforting, and felt quite authentic — especially the braised pork and dumplings. Portions were decent and everything came out hot and fresh. Service was quick and friendly. Would happily come back when craving Shanghai-style food."
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"Come over with a friend to try this Shanghainese food and the experience is very good. The service is warm and the food is fast. We ordered the signature little cage bag and raw frying bag, which tasted amazing and had a rich soup. To go with it, a refreshing little stir-fry of lotus pond (with lotus flakes and murine ears) was also ordered, and the ingredients were fresh. It's really nice to eat such an authentic home flavor here, and will come often!"
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"Spectacular staffs. Very patient with providing recommendations. 

Food arrived very swiftly, and the food was absolutely on point. Great representation of shanghai food. 

Cannot praise enough of the braised pork belly which was served on a plate with candle below to keep it warm. Absolutely on point

Overall, great service nice environment with a fair price."
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,Really enjoyed the very authentic Shanghai cuisine. I would say it's a rare find in the heart of London and it's just too perfect place to dine before watching devil wears prada !!! The braised pork belly is so tender and flavourful and all the traditional dishes just brings me back to China ✨
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"London's authentic Shanghai flavor, raw frying buns small cage buns must order"
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"As someone who has an attachment to Shanghai snacks, this store really gives me so much satisfaction. It's near the UCL and the location is great. Their raw frying buns were deliberately ordered, with a thin, crisp bottom, and a bite to go down juicy, very authentic! Small cage buns are also excellent, with thin skins and fresh soup. It also ordered a Dongpo meat with rice, stewed soft and sticky, fat and not greasy. Definitely a five-star recommended treasure restaurant!"
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"Beer duck is delicious ，Crab meat soup dumplings are also delicious; they burst with juice in every bite. The environment is nice, and they play good songs. The waiters were very warm and patient."
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,I went there with my family and all of us enjoyed the dinner there. Every dish was very delicious. It’s definitely my top 3 Chinese restaurant in London.
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"As a Chinese grew up near Shanghai, their dishes are authentic. I like the xiaolongbao a lot, reminded me of home ! The service is quite good."
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,"For Winter Solstice and Christmas, we wanted a place where friends could gather and celebrate together.
We felt warm and welcoming here❤️"
Shanghai Family Chinese Restaurant,London,4.8,Super delicious food. I like the noodle with the yellow fish the best. The pan fried bun is authentic as well. And the price is sensible. Just gonna put the restaurant on my take-out list.

Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,"We were looking for a Lebanese restaurant with my girlfriend and we did not regret our choice. Nestled in a quiet little street in the Marais, this restaurant is already our heart! An impeccable service despite the high attendance, and the waiters are good advisors. I recommend 100%!!"
Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,Best Lebanese restaurant we have tasted and I can tell you that we have tasted quite a lot in Paris! Special mention at Tabuleh reminds me of my grandmother's!
Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,"The best lunch in Paris! 
Thanks to Martin, the waiter who followed us and advised us in a perfect way both on the quantity and on the dishes to try. 
Well-kept and welcoming place, prepared and very kind staff, delicious food: the quality of the products is excellent and the dishes delicious. 
We had a mixed appetizer and chicken with rice. The portions are generous. 
A special mention also for the dessert, a memorable MOUHALABIA. 
An experience we will remember for a long time!"
Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,"Fine, authentic dinner in friendly surroundings. A great, good choice for both meat eaters and vegetarians. The service was very nice and helpful, although the restaurant was fully booked."
Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,"What a nice place! On a rainy chilly December evening we ended up in this warm and cozy restaurant. Pleasant, go-free and smooth service, with room for a chat despite being busy. 

Then the dishes. We chose a selection of the chef which turned out to be a real party. Tons round and even mentally satisfied we rolled out two hours later, onto the drizzly streets of Paris"
Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,"A welcome from the aging locals. Not very fine cuisine even if the quantity is there.
In addition we were 2 adults and 2 children and wanted to take 2 formulas at 41 e including mezzes and skewers with accompaniment and mezzes at 31 e to share all this among us. And there the waiter served us a convoluted story that if we took 2 formulas the second formula would not include skewers....in short we felt he wanted us to spend bcp more. 
In the end, everything disappointed us."
Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,"Excellent Lebanese dishes, both in quality and quantity, very warm welcome, pleasant environment, more than satisfactory value for money. Excellent service."
Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,"Very nice atmosphere. Something hidden in a side street.

Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,"Quality of food and top service.

Ideal for vegetarians also thanks to the wide choice of Lebanese cuisine.
Staff and boss attentive."

Assanabel Republic - Marsh,Paris,4.8,The most amazing and welcome experience from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. We realised we had been to the other branch a year ago and Zak was looking after us then and he made such a fuss of us. Sasha was amazing with her recommendations and taking care of us at the table felt like our new happy place a home in Paris

Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette,Paris,4.8,"A winter in Paris, with scalpel: iodine, truffle and smoke noble au Pur’"
Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette,Paris,4.8,"In Pur’, winter is not a scenery: it is a scripture. A large table kitchen that prefers precision to emphasis, depth to sloppiness. Your journey, thought out with a real intelligence of chords, tells a cold and bright Paris: sharp iodine, mastered bitters, noble smoke, and this delicate obsession with relief that makes great houses.

The appetizers give the measure right away. Pike cromesqui is a school departure: crisp without heaviness, impeccable gold, fat just what it takes to whet the appetite. The cheese–radishes–poutargue tartlet has this very Parisian chic: sliced radish, caresses cheese, poutargue sign in marine ink. Then comes the wink — chocolate & foie gras — and we understand that the chef loves adult contrasts: if cocoa remains bitter, we touch this rare delicacy, the one that does not seek to please but to impose.

The oysters then arrive like a reset, a clear passage: the sea without theater. Sylvaner vintages 2022 is a choice of aesthetic, dry, straight, silent — a wine that adds nothing and, for that very reason, enlarges the taste.

The “Harmony” dish is one of the most beautiful ideas on the menu: squash could pour in comfort, but pickles, endive and tangerine come to cut edges. Winter is not sweet: it is structured. The Saumur blanc 2022 “The Unusual” does a sewing job here: tension, straightness, and what it takes to dress the velvet.

Santiago, escorted by farofa, chorizo and lime, is played on a thread. It is the most exposed plate: mother-of-pearl versus smoky, sweetness versus spice, lime as final blade. The Chassagne-Montrachet 2023 is a big table bet: superb if it is chiseled and served with freshness, more fragile if it widens. But we like a house to take on a risk zone — it’s a sign that it’s looking for rightness, not ease.

Then comes the moment when the room drops in a tone: Alba’s white truffle flax. White truffles are not an ingredient, they are a presence. Poultry and foie gras bring roundness, sage and burnt onion draw a shadow. The Rosso Bacher, served with restraint, has the intelligence to stay in its place: accompany the flesh, respect the perfume, never become the subject. On the white truffle, a wine that “shines” is often a wine that destroys; here, the wine serves the kitchen, and that is what makes great.

The linen bar with vadouvan artichoke, black garlic and flame shells is a high aerobatic exercise — the artichoke is a notorious saboteur. And it is here that the sommelier signs one of the beautiful gestures of the evening: Domaine des Ardoisières 2021. Mineral, tense, salty, almost mountainous: it stabilizes the artichoke, encases the umami of black garlic, prolongs the iodine without crushing it. School agreement, rare, memorable.

The buccaneered Wagyu encloses the salt like a dark cathedral: noble smoke, controlled fermentation, luxurious fat. You needed a wine that was ripe, serious, without hardness: Château Meyney 2011 responds present, melted tannins, earth depth, impeccable hold on the umami. A finale that does not shout “power”, but “mastery”.

And the sweet outing is a model of good taste: the buckwheat & Boskoop puffed pancake, black beer and cider, does not seek sugar but adult delicacy. The concluding umeshu – tangy sweetness, stone/almond, freshness – finishes the meal in elegance, without heaviness, as a last sentence pronounced in a low voice.

Verdict: a great table that can write winter. Constructed dishes, intelligent pairings, a progression that gains depth without ever becoming heavier. If we had to summarize: au Pur’, gastronomy is not fireworks — it is architecture"

Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette,Paris,4.8,"Memorable evening in a Purely amazing setting. 
From the entrance we felt the warm welcome of room director Nicolas, a smile that does not leave indifferent. 
Valentin then took over, he guided us to an 8-course formula, to discover the chef's cooking, a Pure pleasure. 
Chloe was exceptionally enthusiastic, we knew how to feel the passion and love of the good things, stars in the eyes when she talks about sauces made by the chef. 
And finally, the cheese trolley, explained by Nataliia, the work and seriousness for the selection is impressive, and the work of the trolley decors is to be highlighted. 
We chose to take 4 food and wine pairings. 
2 with alcohol and 2 without alcohol, the sommelier chef Holly, Lucas and Emanuel knew how to explain with passion the wines, their origins and it was impressive of finesse so it matched exceptionally well with what we tasted. 
In short, a team of passionate, young funny people who take care to make you spend a moment of happiness. 
I recommend without hesitation if you want to discover a chef's kitchen, sublimated by an exceptional room team.

Pur' - Jean-François Rouquette,Paris,4.8,"An unforgettable evening and dining experience! The service was exemplary! My wife and I had the five course tasting menu and it's outstanding. Each and every course was better than the next. The staff, each and every person who helped us, (and it is very much a collabarative effort), was fantastic. We loved our table, where we were seated, but also noted that the restaurant gives ample space and privacy regarding every table within. And, the restaurant in its entirety is really a lovely setting. One of the most memorable dining experiences ever! Our thanks to all at Pur'. Bravo!"

Epicure,Paris,4.8,"UNFORGETTABLE!
I would like to sincerely thank all the teams of the pure epicure for this moment spent with them.
A romantic birthday meal that will remain engraved.
The welcome, the service, the kitchens... exceptional!

A huge thank you to the team for allowing us to meet and visit the kitchens
An unforgettable moment for me. THANK YOU

I tip my hat to the chef obviously but also to the second for the realization of this menu.
New chef, new map and new wonder!

I can only recommend the discovery of the establishment."

Epicure,Paris,4.8,"Recognized for more than twenty years for its elegant setting, this establishment has preserved its pleasant atmosphere and offers a very attentive, professional and warm service. The team is welcoming and some dishes stand out, including blue lobster and pigeon, well executed and beautifully presented. However, the overall culinary experience falls short of what a three-star restaurant expects: the overall quality of the dishes is correct without being remarkable, the prices are excessive compared to the level proposed, the desserts lack creativity and appeal, and the bread selection is disappointing. If this kitchen wants to be modern, it still needs real improvements to achieve the expected excellence in this area."
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"We selected this restaurant for our 40th anniversary wedding.
Suffice to say that the score of 5/5 is deserved in every respect.
During the reservation, telephone reception and then exchange by email the warmest of Madame Charline. On the day of the meal, the Benjamin Room Manager came to us with a broad smile and made us feel comfortable. The other interveners, both the butlers and the sommelier and his assistants, showed a discreet service, courteous but unobtrusive. (I really enjoyed my discussions on wine).
A perfect meal, of course, both in terms of dishes that are so tasty and cooked to perfection (white truffle, lobster, poularde in 2 courses...) and Burgundy wine that is decanted and served at the right temperature.
When we left, Benjamin took us back to the valets, no less kind, who made it their duty to send us a taxi.
The succession of Eric Fréchon was a challenge that Arnaud Faye took up brilliantly.
Thanks to him and thanks to Benjamin with all his team: the past 4 hours were a privileged trip out of time.
It was an experience that we all want to have at least once.

Epicure,Paris,4.8,"Know A. Faye since the Golden Horse. Were very happy for Epicure of this choice having seen the evolution of this cook. Superb meal this week with lobster and ivy with a particularly well thought-out recipe. Fineness, balance and complexity, everything we seek has this level. I hope it lasts. It is difficult to pass after the EF team in desserts, and they would benefit from being more complex in my humble opinion. A note for desserts in 2* or 3*: Where are the pies, mille-feuilles, Paris-Brest etc? A nice technical dessert is good and we want it because only in these establishments you can taste them. But there should also be a large apple pie, a large clafoutis etc... (in season of course!). It's also the great restaurant. A suggestion! Conclusion: big meal. Very good room service and good sommelier friendly and enthusiastic and not pretentious for a penny. It changes! The room is superb, lunch and evening. Very nice French table."
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"Impeccable service. Michele, Mateo and the entire team went out of their way to make sure we had an incredible experience. Food was 10/10, so many surprises brought to the table throughout the night. It was probably the best dining experience we’ve ever had. And we’ve been all over the world and not easily impressed. Not stuffy at all but everyone was dressed up. All men had jackets on. Ladies were in dresses or nice pants suit. Highly recommend- worth the price tag."
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"At Bristol, it feels so good, to consume if possible without moderation."
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"As usual the welcome of all since arrival with the indispensable valet is so pleasant and professional. We immediately feel very well and pampered.
Before dinner, stay at the bar always perfect. Then a few steps to the Epicurus. Installation in a table overlooking the Bristol garden with Christmas trees. It's beautiful.
The entrance to the Bristol is also magical. On the huge ""table"" where I had been able to enjoy a fabulous spring decor with its flowering onions, a very beautiful manger. And yes, you can enjoy the crèches, without religious feelings.
Let's get to the delicious meal. The amuses mouth, Special mention for the oyster. The bread baked on site with special flours and a slightly chilled butter, extraordinary. Starters, mackerel like maki; ravioli with white truffle... Very good.
Dishes, rolled sole stuffed, what a good idea; scallops, perfect cooking. All this is embellished with small ""middlemen"". Then dessert over vanilla. A well deserved three-star. 
But dare I say it? I am more adept at 114, less sophisticated and more affordable cuisine.Question of personal taste.
Departure, and what a pleasure at the reception, the majestic feline Socrates agreed to be fondled. 
In short, an evening worthy of a Christmas fairy. See you soon."
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"When the great three-star chef was gone we feared for the maintenance of these three stars; now, the new chef has kept them and after our passage to the Epicury I can say that it is justified. We spent a memorable evening in this beautiful restaurant. Welcoming, Service and food were perfect. During dinner we were spoiled and surprised by a multitude of small entrees of surprising originality and taste, served by an exemplary brigade. This restaurant fits perfectly into the magnificent setting of the Bristol Hotel. Perfection in Paris!"
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"Dinner to celebrate our 50th anniversary of marriage! What a magic! Everything was exceptional: tasty dishes , culinary explosions , exceptional Service in both professionalism and relationship , really no words to say how much we appreciated and were won over by all the attention offered on this occasion .. we have already frequented other Michelin-starred restaurants but this one is above the lot .
Bravo and thank you to the chef and his whole team!"
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"Georgeous room, Super attentive service. Overall a wonderful experience. Over the top pricing was inline with expectation at a 3 star restaurant. The little extras before and after the meal made it feel very special and worthwhile."
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"This establishment have been famous for over two decades for its beauty atmosphere and outstanding quality of food 
I admit that it might be difficult to visit it under new chef and stuff but i did, the place did not change luckily the service was very good but i was not impressed from the quality of the dishes .yes it was good but far from three stars standards .from the menu we have chosen lets not speak on the exaggerate price 
Two dishes were out standing the Homard blue and the pigeon.the deserts need to be improved far from being attractive .
The luck of bread selection is noticed 
If one can describe this a modern cuisine ? Than it’s definite need improvement to qualify for three stars"
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"Dear Mr. Yosefl,

We were delighted to welcome you among us and we are grateful that you took the time to write us this message, which always mean a lot to us and enable us to improve our relationship with you.

Your feeling is not up to this requirement and does not reflect our constant search for perfection.

Please feel free to revert to us for any of your future inquiries, we would love to have a chance to provide you with a better experience and a better memory during your next visit in Paris.

Everything was perfect: a warm Welcoming, Service both elegant and humorous, delicate and emotional cuisine. Thank you to all the teams for this exceptional evening!"
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"An excellent experience! The team is really attentive and very pleasant, which makes the moment even warmer. The dishes are delicious, well presented and carefully prepared. A real pleasure from start to finish. I highly recommend! Thanks to the 2/8/25 brigade for lunch"
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"Fantastic 3-star Michelin restaurant at Le Bristol. We had the 8-course set menu, and it was one of the best meals and experiences I've ever had. It certainly isn't cheap, but the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere is unmatched."
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"Epicure at 112 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré is a pinnacle of French gastronomy. Under Chef Eric Frechon’s masterful hand, each dish — from the legendary truffle-stuffed macaroni to exquisite seasonal creations — showcases extraordinary precision and artistry. The serene, elegant setting, impeccable service, and a world-class wine list create an unforgettable dining experience. Every moment at Epicure feels like a celebration of French culinary excellence, making it a must-visit for anyone seeking the finest Paris has to offer."
Epicure,Paris,4.8,"Possibly the best place to experience the best of high-end French cuisine. The food is wonderful, the setting is marvelous, the service is outstanding. Not a flaw. Quite expensive, but worth it all. There is a great tasting menu, with many more bites than the noted number of courses. All of the staff are pleasant and friendly, trying to relate to the guests. Just a wonderful experience."

Restaurant Biscotte,Paris,4.8,"Small restaurant in the 15th district of Paris. Bib gourmand Michelin. 8 tables, small menu: 3 or 5 courses, meat, fish or vegetarian.

Fine cuisine in flavors and presentation.
A considerate service.
Smart wine list.
Relevant price.

Restaurant Biscotte,Paris,4.8,We had a wonderful dinner with excellent service. Our server went out of her way to ensure my partner had an excellent birthday experience.
Restaurant Biscotte,Paris,4.8,"A really warm welcome with a cosy contemporary vibe. The food was faultless. Delicious, varied and so beautifully presented. A good wine list - we thought the selection was well thought out and great value. The waitress was excellent - so friendly and helpful (especially putting up with our very mediocre French) whilst the chef was hard at work in the open kitchen. I’m lucky enough to eat regularly in restaurants but rarely feel compelled to review. Would 100% recommend and will definitely return here on my next visit to Paris. Book now. You will not regret it"

Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,I keep booking a reservation online and I keep getting an email saying my reservation is canceled. What is the best way to make a reservation at this restaurant?
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,Is it easy to turn up and get a table here or is it better to make a reservation?
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,My family and I dined here on New Years Eve and had such a great time! The setting is intimate and cozy. The food was delicious (especially the beef bourguignon). The staff were amazing… they were funny and attentive and really made our new years dinner feel festive. We especially enjoyed when the disco music came on around 11 and the patrons were all singing and drinking bubbly. It was exactly the right vibe for a new years meal! I was so glad I chose it and my family was thrilled. Super fun! Highly recommend when in Montemartre!
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,Very good foie gras and duck with cherries and beuf bourgingnon. Very professional kitchen with dishes coming out when they should. Very very friendly owner Sufian who also did happily all of the serving. Highly recommended.
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,"This is absolutely my favourite restaurant. The wait staff are so lovely, the food is exquisite,"
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,"This is absolutely my favourite restaurant. The wait staff are so lovely, the food is exquisite, the ambiance is second to none. If you are looking for the perfect French dining experience whilst in Paris I recommend this cute little place. The escargot is delicious, the veal melts in your mouth and the profiteroles are naughty but very nice, and the French liqueur coffee is the best I’ve ever tasted. So worth the visit, I know I will return again again. To the chef and staff thank you so much for such an amazing dining experience again!"
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,"Very good experience! I advise! Homemade foie gras: a delight! Crayfish salad, idem. Magret and grilled bar: like a delight! Super friendly staff!"
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,"A real Parisian brasserie at the foot of the sacred heart with a nice view of Paris. 
friendly, commercial and friendly staff. simple but effective traditional cuisine! the dishes are tasty and well served. special mention for the Burgundy sauce."
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,"We had a lovely lunch here following a wet and windy visit to Sacre Coeur. The restaurant is just around the corner and it was a warm and delightful welcome! We had the steak, boeuf bourguignon and the duck which was all excellent. The window tables offered a stunning view over Paris. The whole experience was a real highlight and we look forward to visiting again when we return to Paris."
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,"The bœuf bourguignon) delicious, presented as in the photos 🤌🏻... well accompanied with a glass of Cote du Rhone. 10/10!

Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,"Visited for dinner to end our trip, just stumbled upon it. Such a lovely way to end our trip, our favourite meal we had. Beef bourguignon and snails were both cooked to perfection as well as the duck! 
Service was also really great, lovely restaurant."
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,"Absolutely outstanding. Sure, the view was lovely but the food and the service were outstanding. Sofien, I hope I have spelt his name correctly, made the evening extra special with his attentiveness, humour and his ultimately delicious suggestions of what to eat. This restaurant was the hit of our 6 day Paris food tour. We experienced the most incredibly delicious Beef Bourguignon. If we're ever back in Paris, you'll find us at the window table enjoying a nice glass of wine and a tasty meal."
Le Cabanon de la Butte,Paris,4.7,Stumbled across this amazing little restaurant after visiting Sacre Ceour. What a fabulous find. Food was beautiful and exceptionally good value for money. Great service and staff were friendly. Would definitely recommend

Les Apôtres De Pigalle,Paris,4.8,"We booked my birthday meal here as we were going to the Moulin Rouge, which is only a 5 minute walk from the restaurant and we were really impressed with the previous reviews.

We had a wonderful experience; the owner is so welcoming as soon as you walk through the door and we were offered a free shot and he took the time to explain the menu to us in detail. 
The food was exceptional and we would highly recommend the salmon ceviche, duck breast, beef tataki and the mixed sharing platter. 

Champagne and red wine were excellent and reasonably priced and the free chocolate birthday dessert at the end of the evening was very much appreciated. 

Overall, a wonderful restaurant and an ideal spot for a meal before the Moulin Rouge."

The salmon is cooked to perfection and the smoked smell takes it to another culinary level. I really enjoyed it. The duck breast was the best we had during a 2 week trip to Paris. They also recommended an excellent wine (Premises, Cornas). They are very accommodating to dietary restrictions. They modified a dessert so my husband could have it without dairy and gluten.

Le Maxan Restaurant,Paris,4.8,"A fusion of Parisian elegance and sophistication, the 8th Arr. - Élysée neighborhood in Paris is a testament to the city's opulent past. Home to the illustrious Champs-Élysées, the neighborhood offers a plethora of high-end shopping experiences, from iconic brands like Louis Vuitton and Chanel to the iconic Galeries Lafayette. The grand Arc de Triomphe stands majestically at one end of the avenue, a must-visit for any traveler. Dining options range from Michelin-starred restaurants to quaint cafes offering a taste of authentic French cuisine. With multiple metro stations and bus stops, the neighborhood is well-connected, making it easy for travelers to explore the rest of the city. The tranquility of Parc Monceau provides a welcome respite from the neighborhood's metropolitan buzz, making the 8th Arr. - Élysée an ideal base for those seeking a blend of cultural immersion and high-end leisure."

Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"Tripadvisor is not responsible for this summary or the opinions in it. For more information, please read the traveler reviews and learn more about how the site works."
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,The place has no sophistication of a star but the food speaks for itself!!! Gentle service and delicious dishes. I ordered a chicken q was juicy and soft that came accompanied by a well made mto rice x simple and delicious. My husband and daughter ordered meat dishes that were equally tasty and in very generous portions!!! Dessert also liked !!!
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"We found this very nice, comfortable and typically French, non-touristy place a stone's throw from Notre Dame. Good food, average prices. The gentleman who greeted us (perhaps the owner) very kind and refined manners (spoken Italian!) the girl who served us, little attention and not cute ways! Too bad, the place loses a point for its service!"
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"The restaurant was very warm and inviting just as advertised on a cold Christmas night. It was recommended by our friends who accompanied us and did not disappoint. All four of us were there enjoying the Christmas markets, wonderful food and great service. We had a wonderful time."
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"We had a really great dinner: the fois gras was delicious and the grilled meat superb (I was born and raised in Tuscany: I know what I’m saying when we talk about grilling).
The staff is super nice (they kindly waited for us, even if we were more than an hour late due to airport delays) and the atmosphere lovely.
The location is stunning: only few steps from Notre Dame 🤩"
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"Good restaurant next to Shakespeare and Company. Wonderful atmosphere, but the fireplace in June was a bit much. Excellent food, good value but indifferent service."
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,the duck legs were above expectations i liked so much the atmosphere was so warm feels like my grandma's house im coming again foe sure
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,Absolutely loved this restaurant. The food was outstanding and the staff was amazing. We ordered crepe Suzette for dessert and it was flambéed to perfection.
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"We had a very delicious dinner in this cozy restaurant. The dishes were confit de canard and the other was rabbit, with very tasty potato sides. The artichoke entree was exceptionally good!"
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,We always go to eat at Le Petit Châtelet when we are in Paris and the food is delicious! It has great atmosphere like an old fashioned French restaurant. Our steak was delicious this evening cooked on the open fire. And my favourite dessert is always the poached pears in red wine with lavender ice cream. It is all so tasty and melts in your mouth. Also the servers are always lovely. We always recommend le Petit Châtelet to friends visiting Paris. And I’m always happy when we come back and this little gem right in the middle of the touristy Quartier Latin is still there and serving top quality food. Bravo.
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"The restaurant is very small. The tables are glued together, which is extremely uncomfortable. We're sitting side by side with our neighbor. The person sitting against the wall is trapped. To get up, the one sitting across the street has to get up and the waiter has to pull the table so she can get out. There is no privacy and it is very easy to hear conversations from neighbours. I think it's an abuse by the restaurant and a lack of respect for the customer. It's not worth being so uncomfortable."
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,Friendly Mood and friendly service. Unfortunately not suitable for vegetarians. The dish the chef improvised was very basic. The rest of the food was correct.
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"We pass it every time we stop in Paris.
The setting and location are top, the menu is very affordable, and the slate very varied."
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,Great ambiance and excellent food. You can’t book online and it’s not easy to book by phone. So I took my chances and turned up when they opened.Glad I did!
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"I think this is the third time here. Much better than it had any right to be, considering it is dead centre in the heart of tourist Paris. Reasonably priced, delicious simple French cooking. It is small and fills up fast so get there before it opens"
Le Petit Chatelet,Paris,4.4,"This restaurant is one of the reasons to go to Paris. Small, warm, convivial, great menu and wine list. There were many locals. We showed up early without a reservation and were promptly seated, although the restaurant filled up shortly. I had an excellent pate de foie gras, tender lamb brochette, and creme brulee. My wife had the steak au poivre and profiteroles for dessert. Everything was excellent, and we left feeling as if we had dined at a fine French country home. Highly recommended."

Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"Highly recommended! Restaurant with typical Provencal cuisine, really very good! Try the ravioli du dauphiné and also excellent stew with potatoes! Being a very popular place there is confusion, I suggest to book otherwise you risk the wait! We would stay there again"
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"Trying to book for a party of 8 was a challenge , I ended up booking 2 tables of 4 and they put them together. We had to wait outside for about 15 mins which I think is the norm on a busy night. We then had to wait again once inside . That said it was worth the wait . Fantastic atmosphere, superb food and service was very good once we were sat at our table. I will definitely be going back here ! A wonderful night !"
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"It was my birthday and the service turned it into a really nice evening. The atmosphere was pleasant, we had a great table for five and a wonderful evening. The tips of the service for food and drinks fit very well, for our vegetarian an extra plate was created from the kitchen. 
We felt very comfortable and will definitely come back"
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"Chez Janou serves generous portions of traditional French dishes. The atmosphere is lively and friendly, and the menu feels authentic rather than tourist-focused."
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"Bad service. The receptionist (possibly maître or manager) was extremely rude, talking to the customers.
I had to show the reservation email to prove it existed.
crowded and tight restaurant, just reasonable food.
Won't come back."
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"Great food, service and lively, electric atmosphere. The place was packed with locals on a Saturday night. Make a reservation well in advance if you want a guaranteed table. We've now been twice and it's quickly become one of our favorite, must-visit spots in the Marais!"
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,We liked the cozy atmosphere of this restaurant. The ravioli was delicious and the steaks were tasty. The staff provided excellent service.
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"Arrivals without reservation at noon but placed very kindly.The wine has orange very fragrant.the gravlax very well presented but not enough confided in salt to my taste.
The portions are hearty the nice decor but the atmosphere is noisy. 
This is a good address reasonable price..We liked"
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"The chocolate mousse was legendary, absolutely delicious. The ratatouille was so tasty. The staff was welcoming and the service was good."
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"Yesterday I was with my partner to have dinner in this restaurant, waiters who serve at the table very good, everything else not to our liking.
Entrecote and potatoes with garlic not to our liking"
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"The manager was extremely disrespectful. The place is very crowded, tight. The food is good, but could improve your initial care, especially with tourists. 

There is no reason to treat people who want to know your restaurant badly."
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"Lovely restaurant with great staff who do what they do really well.

The food is absolutely fantastic, we ordered one main and four starters - prawns, mussels, whitebait, ravioli and cray fish and avacado

Between two of us, it was a bit too much, but we loved every mouthful and would definitely go back the next time we are in Paris

Just don't fill up on the bread before the good comes out!"
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"I arrived for my lunch reservation and immediately was struck by the noisy, evocative atmosphere of this very crowded space. The tables were crowded, as were the walls with old posters and Parisian advertisements, all redolent with charm and authentic French culture. Unfortunately there was no lunch formula that used the regular menu, so I ordered a main and a dessert a la carte. My main was Sea bass fillet with tapenade, and let me tell you it was DELICIOUS. My best meal in Paris this trip, considerably better than the Michelin-tagged place I had tried the day before, Baca'v. The grilled fillet was garnished with (I think) diced onions, scallions and tomatoes, plus there was a green sauce and a lemon to employ. Also sharing the plate was a small spinach frittata. Truly an outstanding dish for 24 euros. For dessert I had ordered the chocolate mousse (12 euros) – but first the friendly waitress asked whether I preferred melon or chestnut. Not knowing what I was in for, I chose chestnut, and it turned out to be a chestnut liqueur to accompany the mousse. Finally a young lad arrived with a large silver tureen filled with mousse, and a large ladle. He asked “how hungry are you” and started dishing out the mousse. He didn’t stop until I said “assez!” and I was now faced with a large mountain of mousse and a small glass of chestnut liqueur. A fabulous end to a fabulous meal!"
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"Typical Provencal, welcome and good service, delicious food! Chocolate mousse not to be missed as well as the rib. The only problem is noise nuisance..."
Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"This restaurant came highly recommended by friends who had been before. The atmosphere is amazing and food is very good. However, the menu is pretty limited. The duck and chocolate mousse are must gets!"

Chez Janou,Paris,4.0,"The Marais is a winding maze of multi-faceted streets that beg to be explored. It bursts with small boutiques, historic buildings, cozy traditional restaurants, and hidden parks. Around each corner, you'll come across little gems of architecture spanning the centuries, from understated medieval towers to classical libraries and 17th century splendor. This neighborhood unites a rich mix of people of all ages, but it's best known for the gay scene mostly in the south and the Jewish community around Rue des Rosiers."

Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,9時からのムーランルージュのショーを観に行く予定なのですが、7時入店で前菜+メイン+デザートのコースで8時半位迄に終了出来ますか？または前菜+メインのみのアラカルトで注文は出来ますか？
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"Beautiful experience in 4 steps, allowing you to discover the entire map by sharing with your partner!"
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"Bust, much too small portions and preselected courses in the 4-course menu are declared a concept, if you reserve 2 menus you get e.g. 2 different starters, which you then have to divide by plate exchange. Some courses can't be appetizingly divided. Much is prepared and is not freshly cooked."
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,Heeelt amazing experience for 2 newlywed couples from Norway. Victor was the perfect waiter who really put his soul into making our experience perfect. We are set menu which consisted of 4 fantastic dishes. We will definitely come back when we celebrate our anniversary.
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"This was one of the most incredible food experiences of my life. These guys are doing gods work. 

Firstly I gotta say the host is absolutely incredible. And the food even better. So it’s a tasting menu. Recommend the full course (8 dishes) if you’re quite hungry. If not they have a half course too (4 dishes) that’s also a good bit of food. Everything just tasted so amazing. The beef entree I had was 35 day aged beef from the French mountains. It was I think the best I’ve ever had. The second best being some A5 wagyu beef I had in Japan. I had to literally slow down and chew very slowly so that I could savor the taste. I had several moments like these. My wife had the fish, which was also absolutely beautiful incredible. The appetizer and amuse bouche were very tasty too. The chef did some stuff with watermelon in an appetizer that I didn’t think was possible. There was also this chicken appetizer with some pine nut sauce and as a South Asian I was so shocked at how much flavor this chef was able to pack into the chicken without any spices. One of the apps was also a salmon thing with very innovative application of fried seaweed and radish. Everything this chef did was mind blowing. The desert was also fantastic and used very innovative Korean and South American ingredients. Food aside, i gotta shout out the host. This dude was hands down, the best host, I’ve ever had at any restaurant. What an incredible knowledgeable guy. But also so polite and such a delight to talk to. I wish this dude worked at every single restaurant i will eat at for the rest of my life. He comes and explains each dish in detail and how to best enjoy it. We also left something and he made an international call i assume (from french to us phone number) to let us know. And gave us great recs for other places to eat in Paris. I am still living in the high of the experience I had the pleasure of experiencing. 

Eating here this was the best part of our trip. 10/10 for sure coming here again next time we visit Paris."
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"My husband and I visited this restaurant while on our honeymoon, and it was truly an unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, the host/server made us feel so welcome. He was warm, kind, and patient, taking the time to explain the menu in detail, recommend a sake pairing, and describe each course beautifully as it arrived at our table.

We both chose the tasting menu, and every course was absolutely delicious—each one somehow better than the last. The flavors, presentation, and overall balance were exceptional.

The restaurant itself is small, cozy, and tastefully decorated, which made the evening feel even more special. It’s no surprise that it’s Michelin recommended. Reservations are required, but it’s absolutely worth planning ahead.

I can’t recommend this place highly enough—an incredible dining experience that made our honeymoon in France even more memorable."
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"Unbelievable experience. 
We arrived as a family and we were immediately put at ease by the boss (despite a little booking concern on our part 😁). 
With his few notes of humor and a smile that did not leave him all evening, he took the time to explain the different formulas and the composition of the dishes. 
Let’s talk in dishes... simply Exceptional... a mixture of Franco-Asian flavors (Korean) that delighted us all. A little attention during dessert (for a birthday) delighted us again. We highly recommend this address, you can go there with your eyes closed. Mr Dimitri 😉"
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"The food is outstanding, both in presentation and flavour. Victor has an incredible way of making everyone feel like they are the only people in the room - explaining every dish, the composition, the layering, which share plate to try first. His wine knowledge is exemplary and the wine list extensive. Closed Monday and Tues and getting a booking in this small, intimate restaurant is not easy, but well worth it if you can!"
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"I live here on the hill and this is one of the top three places to visit, probably #1 before Seb’on and Ose. You will get the gastronomic experience of a Michelin starred restaurant and the wine list of a 5-star palace. I cannot recommend it enough. Hard to get a table given the small size so worth booking in advance or trying your luck last minute if they have a cancellation."
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"My wife and I absolutely loved this gem of a restaurant. Everything in the tasting menu was creative and delicious, and the service felt like dinner at a friend's house. It's not a big menu, but everything is made with care and precision, and curated in a thoughtful way that makes it feel like a special experience. We had never had some of the ingredients before, and even the things we had tried before were imaginatively designed in unique, memorable dishes. While not cheap, the quality felt like a Michelin-starred restaurant, and therefore a value."
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"An extraordinary birthday dinner, worthy of a star!
Great starter to dessert! 
With a lovely team."
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"Thanks to the warm service provided by Victor and the inventiveness of his wife in the kitchen (but also in room), we had a great birthday party yesterday. 
The 5-course menu is a delicious gastronomic walk. 
To be tested without delay!"
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"Charming, intimate spot with a host who embodies hospitatlity. Made us feel welcome and shared his vast wine knowledge graciously. The dinner was clever and delicious while avoiding being twee. It was the perfect way to spend our 25ht anniversary."
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"Frankly disappointed by this restaurant and this rating in Tripadvisor. Not consistent with photos and comments. We took the tasting menus for 89€ and frankly for me it is not worth them! It’s not bad but not enough sought after, not well presented and it is sorely lacking in originality. The restaurant is very small, the tables are very simple, at 89€ there is no tablecloth, etc...
In short very disappointed with the experience."
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"Celebrating Valentine’s Day in Paris I wanted to eat somewhere special but not too posh. And Signature Montmartre delivered. We had the 8 course tasting menu. Of course every dish can’t get full score with 8 courses. But all over very good, beautiful presentation and extra credit for the tuna fish. So now it’s about 4 dots. The full score is because of the owners. They fill this place with such a good wibe and the knowledge and recommendation in what to drink was top notch."
Signature Montmartre,Paris,4.8,"We had dinner here to celebrate a special occasion and it was a real experience. The place is small but very intimate and welcoming. 
We chose the 8-course course and it was an escalation of crazy tastes and combinations, fish, meat, vegetables and many particular ingredients and spices that together created unique and extremely tasty dishes. 
The cuisine is a fusion of French and Asian and the owner Victoire accompanied us on this culinary journey with great sympathy and professionalism also suggesting an excellent French white wine, fruity as we liked and telling us each dish.
Excellent desserts and liquors.
Congratulations!!!! 🥂🥂"

Nectar,Paris,4.9,A lovely intimate dining experience. The cocktails are inventive and interesting. We really liked the Bolatus which is like porcini old fashion. We had the Apis 5 courses dinner. The bread is excellent. We really enjoyed the trumpet ravioli and the duck. Everything else is a little forgettable. Everyone has been incredibly nice.
Nectar,Paris,4.9,"While staying at Hotel Maison Mère, I treated myself to dinner at Nectar, the onsite restaurant, and it turned out to be one of the most memorable meals of my life. Guests can choose between an à la carte menu or a prix fixe tasting menu—poetically described as “five major acts.” I chose the prix fixe, and honestly, I lost count of the courses. What I can say is that every dish was exquisite in both presentation and flavor—moody, creative, and adventurous without ever feeling stuffy or pretentious.
The journey began with three delicate bites—a playful mix of caviar, citrus, and a jewel-like jelly on a shell—setting the stage for what was to come. A standout was the semi-dried tomatoes in chilled lavender and shiso water, which tasted as if they had been cultivated with daily devotion. The tuna crudo with melon, marigold, and smoked tuna belly was the essence of summer, while a sun-dried tomato puff pastry simply melted in my mouth.

Then came a perfectly warm, personal loaf of bread—so thoughtful it felt like a gift I wished I could bring home to family. The brown mushroom ravioli with sage butter and summer truffle could have been my daily comfort meal forever. A dramatic presentation arrived in the form of a crab shell filled with spider crab, jelly, artichoke, kumquat, and basil—evoking the foamy bubbles of ocean waves. My main course, steamed meagre fish with peas, lava beans, candied citron, and verbena kefir, was fresh, delicate, and balanced—a dance of flavors.

The cheese plate offered four perfectly curated selections with a touch of sweetness, followed by raisin bread so comforting I found myself seeking it out at bakeries for the rest of my stay. Dessert, however, was the showstopper: a Nica Brown chocolate tart with pear, cumin, and warm peanut emulsion. Words cannot do it justice—I found myself texting photos to my husband with pure delight. It was edible art, a masterclass in flavor. A refreshing lemon ice cream, a crisp topped with salted caramel, and a pair of petits fours—a handmade truffle and cranberry jelly—were the perfect finale.
Cocktails deserve their own mention: inventive, playful, and just as beautifully crafted as the food. The space itself is stunning, with stylish art deco design that feels both relaxed and elevated. On Thursdays, live music adds to the atmosphere, and on quieter evenings, it’s an ideal place to linger in conversation.

Chef Aurélien Lasjuilliarias is not only a chef but a true artist. What makes Nectar extraordinary is how it marries high culinary creativity with a genuine sense of warmth. Dining here feels like being welcomed into the home of friends who happen to be exceptionally talented at hospitality and cuisine. I cannot wait to return."

We ordered the ‘pollen’ menu, which had 3 courses but they gave us extras, like a pre-dessert and biscuits as a gift when we left. The waiters were all excellent, describing the dishes (most of them spoke English too). It was very good value for money and in a lovely setting."

A Michelin-starred restaurant kitchen (in my opinion it deserves at least one star and I wish the Chef to get it soon) with Chef Aurélien Lasjuilliarias superb.
A big thank you to Alan Perez for his Alchemic Cocktails prepared delicious and thank you for his ""Italian"" which helped us to better understand the dishes.
We already want to go back"
Nectar,Paris,4.9,"Dear Massimiliano,

Thank you so much for this truly wonderful review, it means a great deal to us ✨

We are delighted that your experience at Nectar felt so magical. Your praise for Chef Aurélien Lasjuilliarias is a real honor: his creativity, precision, and passion are at the very heart of our cuisine, and your words are incredibly encouraging.

A special thank you as well for highlighting Alan Perez and his beautifully crafted “alchemical” cocktails, not to mention his Italian, which clearly helped create an even deeper connection with the dishes 🍸🇮🇹

Knowing that you already wish to return is the greatest compliment we could receive. We truly look forward to welcoming you back soon for another memorable culinary journey at Nectar.

Warm regards,
Sophiane from the Nectar Team 🐝"

Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"Such an amazing experience! Service was very attentive, food was amazing, and drinks were delicious. We even got some lemoncello shots to celebrate our friends birthday! Would recommend🩷"
Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"Have you ever seen the movie ""Ratatouille""?
Well you will be exactly in these places that give off a warm and conducive atmosphere for travel.

And what a journey!
Unpretentious any
Without being a gourmet 

This restaurant has nothing to envy the older ones and yet .. everything is there

The setting (evening for us)
A mastered card perfectly and exclusively ""homemade"" (real!)

Welcome? Warm, friendly but then... poetry takes its rightful place!

Each dish, prepared with care, ... is told to you, detailed with sweet words coated with an Italian accent (mamma mia girls and especially avoid drowning in the eyes so particular of the poet!) that already your taste buds are on the trip! 

And believe that they will NOT be disappointed! 

The rest ... it's up to you to find out and make your own trip! 

Personally have taken particular pleasure in discovering this place. The reviews were therefore not lying but are far from honoring him! 

Hoping he'll keep growing that little something that makes a difference"
Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"We had a wonderful evening. Warm, attentive service and really good Italian food. The tuna was perfect, the meat super tender, all in all very delicious. Plus a cozy atmosphere. We will come back! Grazie mille!"
Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"The name “Origini” is perfect- this is truly original, creative food! Really not your typical Italian restaurant. Everything was wonderful, and the host spent a long time explaining the dishes and bringing extra things to try. We look forward to coming many more times."
Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"Excellent cuisine, perfect service... this is the second time we come and again one without fault we will come back!"
Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"Wonderful, the taste is there and the advice too! We had a great time and will be back with great pleasure 👍🏻"
Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"We have enjoyed the dinner and atmosphere in this restaurant. Well situated, great choice of delicious dishes, fresh baked bread and friendly waitress. We already recommended to our friends. Thanks, we would like to be back again."
Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"Absolutely amazing experience! The carbonara was one of the best I’ve ever had — perfectly creamy, rich, and full of flavor without being heavy. You can really taste the quality of the ingredients and the authentic Italian touch. The pasta was cooked exactly al dente, and the balance of cheese, pepper, and guanciale was spot on"
Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"Excellent cuisine, homemade, typically Italian and very very good. Warm welcome, I highly recommend this address."
Origini - Ristorante Italiano,Paris,4.9,"The smile , the accent singing and warm at the reception we sit in Italy as soon as we arrive. Then from the starter to the dessert (an ovviamente tiramisu!) everything reinforces us in this impression. A homemade bread , and an exceptional Sicilian olive oil I could have eaten only that ... a mixture of simplicity and originality that leaves an exceptional taste. That of the Italian sun, to which we promise to return very quickly!"

Lichette,Paris,5.0,"We had a great evening at Lichette! 

What started as a simple romantic dinner quickly turned into a real explosion of flavors. We couldn’t resist tasting everything, and between the perfectly cooked line salmon and the fried octopus absolutely to fall, we feasted! 
Fried octopus /Yogurt /Chilli sticks/Portobello/Candied onions/Thai chives and line salmon/Carrot puree/Orange frozen knee /Chevil salad/Sabayon Yellow wine: I'm still sick of it, just thinking about it! 

Thank you for the excellent wine advice, the bottle was delicious, perfectly adapted to our desires and the choice of dishes. The team, of rare kindness, creates a warm and relaxed atmosphere, while remaining incredibly professional. 

It’s really the kind of place where you feel good, comfortable, almost like home, but with that little extra that makes all the difference.

An unmissable address to discover and rediscover without hesitation!
Thanks again and see you soon!!"

Pizzeria Arrivederci,Paris,4.9,"The Latin Quarter bursts with intellectual life, architectural splendor and ongoing merriment. The small streets are filled with classical buildings, student bars and lively eateries while the squares are dominated by historic monuments. The area is defined by the 800-year-old Sorbonne University, where Latin once prevailed, and is famous for the Pantheon which celebrates the great men and women of France. During the day students rush from classes to the library and intellectuals people watch from the terraced cafés. As night time falls the surrounding establishments fill up and the merriment really begins. The liveliest parts are around Rue Mouffetard, lined with crêperies and international street food eateries, and Place de la Contrescarpe characterised by terraced brasseries, this neighborhood provides real nourishment for the mind, belly, and soul."

Mi'ndujo - Centro Commerciale Aura,Rome,4.8,"The Humble Wonder of the Tuber: A Celebration of the Potato
It is hard to find an ingredient that can boast such a firm and versatile place in kitchens around the world as the potato. It is no exaggeration to say that this humble tuber is a true masterpiece of culinary nature, capable of turning into a myriad of dishes that warm the heart and delight the palate.
Its strength lies precisely in its chameleonic nature. The potato has the extraordinary ability to adapt to any cooking technique:
 * Boiled or steamed, with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of oil, it offers a simple, clean and surprisingly comforting base. It is the perfect canvas for bold toppings or a light and genuine side dish.
 * Roasted or baked, its rind becomes crisp and golden, almost caramelized, while the inside remains soft and floury. They are the ideal companions to any meat or fish, with that rustic and unmistakable taste.
 * Made into puree, it reaches the peak of creaminess, a velvety cloud that, enriched with butter or cream, is the very definition of comfort food.
 * And let's not forget the unparalleled French fries: the contrast between the crispy exterior and soft interior is a joy for the senses, a pleasure that is almost impossible to resist.
Beyond preparation, the potato brings with it an inherent satisfaction. It is nourishing, fulfilling and has that earthy, slightly sweet taste that brings us back to simple, authentic things. It is the democratic ingredient par excellence, loved by everyone and present on every table, from haute cuisine to the most homely meal.
In conclusion, the potato is not just a side dish, it is a silent protagonist who deserves all the honors. It's a complete dining experience in itself, proving that sometimes the simplest things are even the most extraordinary.
Vote: 5 stars out of 5 (For infinite versatility and guaranteed pleasure.)"
Mi'ndujo - Centro Commerciale Aura,Rome,4.8,"Local recommended, lots of variety of food and helpful staff very fast in preparing the order, recommended for those who are open to new experiences."
Mi'ndujo - Centro Commerciale Aura,Rome,4.8,"Mi'Ndujo is a real celebration of the most genuine flavors of Calabria! If you are looking for high-quality street food that does not compromise on authenticity, this is the place."
Mi'ndujo - Centro Commerciale Aura,Rome,4.8,"Local super recommended, friendly staff super helpful and attentive. Very good food. We tried chokosticks"
Mi'ndujo - Centro Commerciale Aura,Rome,4.8,"I tried Mi 'ndujo during a day of shopping with friends at Aura Mall and I must say it was a pleasant discovery. We opted for a mix of classic panzerotti and some specials, and each bite was a real explosion of flavor. They were all fried to perfection, dry and stuffed with top quality ingredients. The mozzarella, in particular, spun that was a wonder! It's not your usual fast food. Service at the counter was quick and the staff very friendly and smiling, despite the crowds. Great Price quality ratio for a quick but tasty lunch, which brings a piece of Puglia to Rome. Highly recommended to all lovers of authentic Italian street food!
Every Thursday with 15 euros unlimited sandwiches and beer at 2 euros."

I understand the attempt to overdo the reinterpretations, but what I ate was not a tiramisu. It would probably be better to give it a different name."
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"Everything wonderful: attentive service, well-kept environment and excellent menu, perfect fusion of tradition and modernity"
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"I could not go to Rome without going back to Ad Hoc .
It is excellent, a total experience, from the drinks on arrival to the chefs tasters , wonderful menu and wine pairing …. This place is perfect .
Thank you Ad Hoc … I will be back ♥️👏👏👏"
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,Had a truly wonderful experience celebrating my birthday. It was an outstanding experience in every aspect. Huge thanks to the team at Ad Hoc.
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"This is the second time I have visited this restaurant and to quote my husband - I would fly to Rome just to eat here. Each visit the staff are so lovely, the food AMAZING, the wine, so good. And I love how gorgeous the restaurant looks. If you are coming to Rome and not eating here you are making a mistake!"

Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"What a wonderful experience! A group of friends and I traveled to Rome for New Year's. While there, we had dinner at Ad Hoc. The ambiance was warm and inviting, the service was impeccable, and the food was mouth watering! We each ordered a tastings menu with a wine pairing. Our server even adjusted the menu to cater to a vegetarian friend. Well worth it! I will definitely visit again!"
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"We chose this restaurant to spend New Year's Eve and we were delighted with our choice! The menu was delicious and the wines offered matched beautifully. The staff is very friendly and friendly.
An unforgettable evening! Thank you very much for this experience and congratulations to all!"
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,The service was very good. Regarding the food the wine was good but the food without taste but excellent presentation.
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,Suffering food but good presentation. Good wines. Good service. Conclusion: poor price quality ratio. I won't come back.
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"We had a 3‑day visit to Rome, staying at Il Monastero Collection Hotel on the south side of the Roman Forum. We usually base ourselves in the Monti district, but thought we’d try something new. Our only concern was whether we’d have a good choice of nearby eateries — thankfully, those concerns disappeared immediately, as we discovered a fantastic option right next door.

Ad Hoc is a wonderfully atmospheric restaurant set in a 16th‑century building built onto the ancient foundations of the Circus Maximus, within the Colosseum–Palatine archaeological park. As with all our trips to Rome, I did my homework — and even before tasting the food, you get a real sense of being in a historic and special setting.

The dining room is beautifully ambient, softly lit, and blissfully free of excess noise, making conversation easy.

I don’t usually go for the full sequence of Italian courses these days, preferring to jump straight to pasta or a meat/fish dish, but the menu here was so tempting that I ended up having all four courses. We were welcomed with complimentary starters and a glass of rosé, which was a thoughtful touch. My meal included lobster tail antipasti, fillet beef ravioli with white truffle as the primi, a sea bass fillet for the secondi, and — somehow — an excellent dessert to finish. Every dish was fine‑dining quality. Truly outstanding.

The wine list is extensive in the best possible way, with options across all budgets. I can’t recall the exact sauvignon blanc we chose, but it was a lovely dry bottle at around €50. There are both cheaper and far more premium choices available. The waiting staff were extremely knowledgeable and gave excellent advice on pairing wine with each course.

I can’t remember the exact total of the bill — I believe it was around €250 — which I felt was very reasonable for a fine‑dining experience in such a unique location.

We’ll definitely be returning to this part of the city, and to this wonderful restaurant. Thank you."
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"The highlight of our holiday, the service is one of the best i ever experienced, food is very good and the wine selection is on point. One of the main reasons for going back to Rome ! Prices are very reasonable the area is on the outskirts so no crazy touristic, everything was perfect and they provided gluten free options too."
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"We celebrated New Year's Eve here. Great atmosphere, very attentive staff and well-measured menu. 
Nothing was missing."
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"We had an amazing dinner at this fabulous restaurant. Everything from the complimentary touches (bubbles, pre and post dinner courses), the food and service were flawless. We would highly recommend this for a romantic dinner with great wine and food!"
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,"One of the very best restaurants in Rome. The derive we received was superb, attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable, attention to detail, food was absolutely outstanding, really looked after us and as it was our anniversary and my wife’s birthday they also went above & beyond with a small cake. Barbara has a fantastic restaurant here and when we are next in Rome we will try thier other place. Thank you again for such a wonderful meal experience."
Ad Hoc Ristorante - Circo Massimo,Rome,4.9,Ad Hoc by the Circus Maximus was the best dining surprise we had when we were in Rome celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. We should have reserved but didn’t and we’re fortunate to get a table in the outdoor seating overlooking the Circus Maximus. The restaurant staff were so welcoming and explained the menus so well. The choice of wines to accompany our meal were excellent and we enjoyed the tasters that arrived during our meal too. Highly recommend this gorgeous restaurant. Do book. And prepare for a real treat. We will come back when next in No Rome. Thank you!

Grazia & Graziella,Rome,4.7,"Trastevere (""beyond the Tiber"") is like a faded postcard, a little worn around the edges but still charming. With its wide-open piazzas, meandering streets, weathered Renaissance buildings, and overgrown personality, it's become an irresistible mecca for visitors. Trastevere is an enclave of entertainment - a rotating set of street performers entertains almost every night, and unforgettable eateries and bars pepper its piazzas and side streets. For a trip to the past, visit the southern and western flanks of Trastevere for pockets of yesteryear, less traversed areas with a residual 1960s and 70s Roman vibe."

Bufalero,Rome,4.8,Un celiaco può mangiare la carne nel vostro ristorante?buona sera grazie
Bufalero,Rome,4.8,"We decide to try it, so instinctively seeing those beautiful meat dishes. 
It was really a wonderful experience! At first glance, super welcoming and helpful, I receive Luca. 
Then at the table we were served by Alex, also an excellent wine connoisseur who will advise you. 
In short, a beautiful reality, where especially those who are the masters and 'the wide choice of meat of excellent quality, tender and tasty. ""quality is priceless"" .. but despite everything have a really good value for money. 
Safe return!"
Bufalero,Rome,4.8,"We had a great meal, beautiful evening and 10+ service 
Alex nice and very good!! We will definitely come back for the good food and atmosphere"
Bufalero,Rome,4.8,"We came to celebrate a family birthday, we were served by Francis who explained and advised us on the various cuts and types of meat available, it was really kind and clear. The meat was great, well cooked, tasty, and the right price for what we ate. We will definitely be back!"

Bufalero,Rome,4.8,"We had a great time, the staff very kind, especially Alex, who was good at recommending a great cut of meat and a good wine."
Bufalero,Rome,4.8,"High quality, even if the tartare was a bit bland, you bring things that you can match but I think it should be marinated first to get flavor 

The excellent steak, even if for meat at the counter you start from a bit ‘high prices 

I think a mini saucer of grilled vegetables is expensive 7€ 

And the sweet same thing 7/8€ a bit excessive 

Reiterating quality ok, value for money I was not very happy"
Bufalero,Rome,4.8,"I spent a memorable evening in this restaurant, where I could taste truly excellent dishes, excellent quality meat as well as hamburgers. fresh ingredients and a curated presentation that enhanced every dish. The staff was simply impeccable: courteous, professional and always attentive to the needs of customers, without being intrusive. The atmosphere was welcoming and refined at the same time, perfect for both an intimate dinner and an evening with friends. I highly recommend trying this gem: you leave the place not only satisfied, but also enthusiastic about the attention to detail and the quality of service. I will definitely be back!"
Bufalero,Rome,4.8,Small but basic room. Excellent meat and service. Alex served us a very good waiter. We will return.
Bufalero,Rome,4.8,Great meat and service! Cozy and youthful place with waiter Alex ironic and prepared about food.
Bufalero,Rome,4.8,"It is the second time we return and it is always a great pleasure! We tried another cut of meat recommended by Francis who followed us throughout dinner, recommended the right cut based on what were our requests. Value for money right👍"
Bufalero,Rome,4.8,"We were served by Alex, and we had a truly exceptional gastronomic experience. The food was excellent, and the service was outstanding. Special thanks to the restaurant and especially to Alex for his professional and attentive approach. We highly recommend this place to everyone!"

Prefetti 19,Rome,4.8,Food and atmosphere are wonderful! I loved the care the staff put into providing a fantastic meal for you to enjoy. You can tell they truly love what they do.
Prefetti 19,Rome,4.8,"Excellent place, delicious food—filling but lightFantastic service – the staff recommended a perfect wine pairing. Limited seating – booking ahead is a must during the high sensor. Additionally, hotel guests get a discount. I would love to come back here again sometime!"
Prefetti 19,Rome,4.8,The food is really great! Very good and friendly staff. I will definitely return with my friends to enjoy a nice day in a quiet and cozy place like this.
Prefetti 19,Rome,4.8,"We went in encouraged by the good reviews, what can we say… really disappointing!
The restaurant seems to be part of a hotel reception, with people constantly coming in and out carrying luggage. The tables are so small that barely two plates could fit at the same time. The food was mediocre and poorly presented; it looked like hospital cafeteria meals.
The only positive note is the wine list, but with exorbitant prices, and the staff, although kind, cannot make up for the shortcomings of this place."
Prefetti 19,Rome,4.8,"A MUST visit on your trip to Rome. 

From the moment we were seated at our table, Jack was very welcoming, and personable. He explained the wine we chose in great detail from how the grapes are grown to the specific taste. Jack was very helpful in helping us choose our food by explaining the menu. When the food arrived, he explained specific details about how some of the dishes were crafted. This level of service made the experience feel very memorable and personal. 

The food was delicious, and the portions were very generous. Each dish had incredible flavour and the ingredients were very fresh and high quality."
Prefetti 19,Rome,4.8,"Great place, very nice interior.
Friendly and professional staff.
Wide choice of cocktails, very good and sought after"
Prefetti 19,Rome,4.8,"10 and praise! As soon as we entered the place we were enveloped by the kindness, sympathy and helpfulness of the staff. Super professional. Local food and not mass “tourist-catcher” cuisine. Maritozzo with artisan bread and SPECTACULAR carbonara (with the plus of fresh pasta prepared directly by them). Super recommended!"

Prefetti 19,Rome,4.8,"Centro neighborhood in Rome, with its historical allure, beckons to the culturally curious. The neighborhood is home to the iconic Pantheon, a testament to Rome's ancient grandeur, and the picturesque Piazza Navona, a lively square filled with Baroque masterpieces. The narrow cobblestone streets are lined with an array of trattorias offering traditional Roman dishes, charming gelaterias, and artisan boutiques. With easy access to multiple bus lines and the Metro, Centro makes traversing the Eternal City a breeze. A stay in Centro offers an authentic immersion into Rome's rich tapestry of history, art, and gastronomy."

Dumpling Bar,Rome,4.7,"Portuense, a charming neighborhood in Rome, is a time capsule of authentic Roman life. The Mercato di Porta Portese, a sprawling flea market, is a weekend staple where locals and tourists alike hunt for treasures among a dizzying array of stalls. The area is also rich with culinary delights, from the mouthwatering pastries at Pasticceria De Bellis to the rustic Roman dishes at Trattoria Perilli. The neighborhood is easily accessible, with Trastevere Station offering direct trains to Fiumicino Airport, and plenty of bus and tram lines connecting to Rome's city center. Those with a desire to explore the less-trodden path will find Portuense's quiet streets and hidden gems truly enchanting."

Mr. Lucian, from Romania, served us very professionally, recommended an excellent wine and we spent a wonderful evening with the family. We will definitely be back!"
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Thank you for sharing your experience. We’re glad you enjoyed the warm atmosphere, the food and the quality of the service. I’ll gladly pass your compliments on to Lucian, who will surely appreciate them. We hope to see you again soon"
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"We stayed here twice during our stay in Rome. The restaurant is quite small. The service excellent, friendly and attentive.
The food is really very, very good and resourceful in detail. The menu isn't very extensive, but that's a sign to me that the food is fresh. The portions are sufficiently large, considering that an Italian meal usually consists of antipasti, primo, secundo and possibly dessert. Anyone who thinks they have to be satisfied with only one main course might be disappointed.
On our next stay in Rome we will definitely come back."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Thank you for such a thoughtful and detailed review. We’re delighted that you appreciated the quality, freshness and creativity of our cuisine. Visiting us twice is a great compliment for us. We look forward to welcoming you again on your next trip to Rome."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"I recommend this property. It's the second time I've come and I'm still as satisfied.
We were served by Valentina who was in great care. Wonderful dishes and wines, offer gluten-free. Go ahead!"
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Thank you for your trust and for visiting us again. We’re happy that this second experience was just as satisfying. I’ll gladly pass your compliments on to Valentina, who will surely appreciate them. We hope to see you again soon."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"We had a very good experience. The restaurant is so beautiful and the food is very tasted and well presented 😊
Anastasiia it's very kind and friendly which contributed a lot for our experience here. We will come back ❤️"
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Thank you for this lovely review. We’re delighted that you enjoyed the atmosphere, the quality of our dishes and their presentation. I’ll gladly pass your kind words on to Anastasiia, who will surely appreciate them. We look forward to seeing you again."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"The food was fantastic, service wonderful. It's worth ordering the dessert. 

We were served by Valentina, who was very friendly and helped us to choose the dishes."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Thank you for your review. We’re happy you enjoyed our cuisine and service, and that the dessert made a great impression. I’ll gladly pass your compliments on to Valentina, who will surely appreciate them. We hope to welcome you again soon."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Excellent discovery close to the Vatican!
An absolutely delicious Italian restaurant: authentic dishes, high quality ingredients and incredible flavors. Everything was perfect, from starter to dessert.
Special mention to Nicolo and Valentina for their warm welcome, professionalism and impeccable service, which made the experience even more enjoyable.
A must-see if you are in the Vatican district. We will return without hesitation!"
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Thank you for this wonderful review. We’re delighted that you appreciated the quality of our ingredients and the authenticity of our cuisine. I’ll gladly pass your kind words on to Niccolò and Valentina, who will surely appreciate them. We hope to see you again soon."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Amazing food and excellent service, no wonder they’ve been in business for decades!"
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"My son and I were recommended this restaurant after arriving in Rome on the same day, and we were so happy that it was right by our hotel, Sant’Anna. It was excellent! Our wonderful server Lucian gave us some ideas for drinks and foods, and we ate and drank like kings! He recommended the special, and it was perfect. He also recommended a spritz the I believe is unique to their restaurant which was delicious. The weather was surprisingly warm, and there were heaters and blankets, so we chose to eat in the tented area outside. It was very cozy! We would like to eat there tonight again, but because it is Sunday, they’re closed. Good for them taking a day of rest on Sunday. We WILL most likely eat there tomorrow again if they’re open on Mondays. This restaurant has been family owned for decades, and you can tell. They have lots of customers who are locals, and the food and service were excellent. I’m so thankful this was the first meal of our trip. What a wonderful way to start! Thank you, Lucien and Ristorante Arlu!"
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Thank you for sharing such a beautiful and detailed review. We’re honored that Arlù was your first meal in Rome and that it helped start your trip in the best possible way. Quality food, attentive service and a family atmosphere are essential values for us. I’ll gladly pass your compliments on to Lucian, who will truly appreciate them. We look forward to welcoming you again."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"We had lunch today at Arlu Restaurant, everything was great, although the dessert of ricotta and pear was memorable. We have been exceptionally cared for by Niccolo. To repeat."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Thank you very much for your kind review. We’re delighted that you enjoyed the quality of our dishes, especially the ricotta and pear dessert, which we truly care about. I’ll be happy to pass your compliments on to Niccolò, who will surely appreciate them. We hope to welcome you again soon."
Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Desperate before so much mediocrity, we went to one of the best rated. Midget tables, disaffected staff, expensive and regular wine. Good bread, right pasta. But charging 27 euros for 2 slices of hard pork tenderloin and bag potatoes and calling it ""roman"" is pathetic. This city is surpassed by London and other capitals of the fritanga. Amazing and sad in equal parts."

Ristorante Arlù,Rome,4.6,"Frocked priests, colorful Swiss Guards, insistent souvenir shop owners, flag-waving tour guides, and pilgrims from around the world. This is the Vatican and Borgo, Rome's most recognized neighborhood which acts as Vatican City's front yard. Aside from the souvenir boutiques and a few food spots, the only business conducted here is papal. In the daytime, the tiny medieval sector bustles with holy activity, as visitors vie for elbow room, or stand in line for a visit. Once the sun sets, the neighborhood is transformed into a quiet and picturesque hamlet."

Imàgo,Rome,4.5,Is it a fixed menu? Do you cater for vegetarian and vegan options. My wife does not eat fish meat or eggs
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"We had the 'Error' set menu and it was amazing. I have several food allergies and the staff were very diligent, so all I had to do was enjoy the food. Every course we had was delicious, but special mention to the turnip tops with caviar, lamb and potatoes, lobster, duck and the autumnal citrus fruits. We requested wine pairings and the choices were excellent. The service is wonderful, all are friendly and knowledgable and prepared to spend time discussing the food and wine with you. To dine here is not just about the food (with is excellent) but also about the service and hospitality, which makes it an occasion."
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"I have been in this paradise, one of the most beautiful places in Rome, impeccable service and local, great dinner, many courses but tiny, I would have preferred a few less courses but portions a little 'more abundant to better savor them."
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"Best restaurant we went to in Rome! And with an amazing view. The restaurant is at the top of the Hassler hotel. The tasting menu was impeccable, as well as service! There were several amazing dishes! We recommend it to everyone who goes there!"
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"I'll be synthetic. Best dinner of the year, On over 120 tables of the year 2025, the best dinner. A confirmation. Andrea Antonini Undisputed king of the capital's cuisine (with hand and internal grip). The hall, the best in Rome. Michelin continues its utopian assessment. Here you should reverse the stars with the other one emblazoned, very very disappointing. Here, at Imago, the kitchen goes to a thousand. ✨✨✨"
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"A crescendo of flavors and emotions in a truly suggestive location, capable of conquering from the first glance. 
The chef’s kitchen is the true beating heart of the experience: carefully studied dishes, selected ingredients and original combinations that enhance the taste without ever being excessive. Each course is a surprise, a discovery of balance and creativity that satisfies the senses.

Service completes the picture impeccably: professional, friendly and attentive staff, always present but never intrusive. The rhythm of the dinner is perfect, leaving room for conversation and full enjoyment of every moment."
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"After mediocre dinners at Moma and Il
convivio, Imago is a winner

At the only privately owned 5 star hotel Hassler, Imago is both traditional and modern at the same time. Even the menu is split as such - classic and creative

We had the former and most dishes are very good to excellent. The best - sea urchin spaghetti, pine forest dessert, fast pace. Not the best - lamb tartare, sea bass, beef main (too fatty). The portions are tiny, but we were full after the meal. The ice cream cart at the end was a nice surprise 

9/10"
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"GOOD EVENING AND, I THINK, THAT THERE ARE NO WORDS TO JUDGE THE DELIGHT, THE PLEASURE OF EATING, THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD INDICATED ON THE MENU, THE FLAVORS THAT LITERALLY APPROPRIATE OUR MOUTH GIVING YOU THE PLEASURE OF TASTING IN ADDITION TO THE NEWS. I'M NOT EXAGGERATING, BUT I JUST TELL THE TRUTH. WE DO NOT FORGET THE FRIENDLY, POLITE AND VERY KIND STAFF IN GETTING COMFORTABLE. IT'S THE PURE AND SIMPLE TRUTH."
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"This is a most marvelous restaurant offering a wonderful view over the city but it's not the view that excels it's the food. We had the Creative Lab tasting menu which throughout all the courses provided delightful and exceptional taste sensations, with flavours and textures full of surprises and joy, all perfectly cooked and presented. A truly wonderful gourmet experience. I should also mention the staff were excellent, attentive and discreet, a rarity amongst many restaurants where the staff are constantly filling your wine glasses etc. Here the staff too seem to be enjoying the occasion. The sommelier was very knowledgeable with advice as to which wine to choose and introduced me to a sparkling Italian wine, Giulio Ferrari Riserva del Fondatore, which for my money can compete with some of the best champagne houses. All in all it was a most memorable experience which will stay with me for a long time to come. I cannot recommend Imago more highly."
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"Excellent. Place that would undoubtedly deserve two stars!
Friendly and knowledgeable staff
Great tasting menu ERROR"
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"I often don't bother to write reviews but looking at the last two poor reviews, I felt impelled to do so. The view is exquisite and they could be lazy about the food but the food rivals the exceptional food. It has a Roman heart but is highly inventive cooking, with a touch of humour in execution and presentation. Truly wonderly flavours, beautifully presented. The service was excellent and the waiters - unusally - seemed to genuinely enjoy serving and love food. A totally joyful gastronomic evening. We ate at another Michelin restaurant in Rome the following evening, that was quite disappointing. Reccommended with no reservations."
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,Disappointing execution for a starred restaurant — lacks the soul of Michelin quality
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"As someone who regularly dines at Michelin-starred establishments, I approached Imàgo with balanced expectations: not just for the cuisine, but for the full experience that a Michelin star should guarantee — excellence in hospitality, atmosphere, and emotional resonance through food.

The result was sadly underwhelming.

While the food presentation met technical standards, the flavors lacked depth and originality. Courses were well-executed but uninspired, and left little emotional imprint — a key element in any truly memorable dining experience.

More concerning was the service. Despite booking well in advance, we were not informed that panoramic-view seats required special request. Upon arrival, we asked politely to switch and were met with a rigid and indifferent refusal. No attempt was made to accommodate or empathize. This kind of cold service undermines what Michelin cuisine is supposed to represent — not just precision, but warmth, care, and thoughtfulness.

In essence, Imàgo offers a beautiful setting, but relies too heavily on its view and reputation. The soul — the human touch, the storytelling, the hospitality — is missing.

I say this with no hostility, only with genuine disappointment. Imàgo feels like a restaurant that once earned a star, but has since settled into complacency. A Michelin star is not just a badge — it’s a promise, and that promise was not kept."
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"We had high expectations when booking Imàgo, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Rome. Sadly, our experience was far from what you would expect at this level.

Despite booking well in advance, we were never informed that the ""vista panoramica"" seats required a special request. When we politely asked to change to those seats upon arrival, the staff refused with a surprisingly cold and dismissive attitude—no flexibility, no courtesy, no explanation.

For a restaurant of this prestige and price range, service should be impeccable. Instead, we felt like we were being processed, not welcomed. The food was decent, but not enough to make up for the poor hospitality.

Overall, very disappointing. We won’t be returning, and we wouldn’t recommend it to others either."
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,We had a lovely experience and enjoyed the beautiful views. We very much enjoyed the creative tasting menu and small portions. We have been to other Michelin restaurants and tried other tasting menus and agree that the size and amount of courses were excellent at Imago. The staff was attentive and courteous. We would come here again and recommend to couples that enjoy a tasting menu and lovely city views. It is a great spot at the top of the Spanish Steps.
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"The location and food were good, but nothing stood out as exceptional for a one-star Michelin restaurant. Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired, they came across as arrogant and inattentive. The staff made the dining experience feel rushed and uncomfortable, as if we were constantly being watched. Shockingly, my plate was cleared before I had even finished eating, which is completely unacceptable at this level of dining. While the view was beautiful and the food enjoyable, this was one of the most disappointing experiences I’ve had at a Michelin-rated establishment."
Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"Imàgo is a true gem in the culinary scene of Rome. The food is exquisite, the service is impeccable, and the views of the city are breathtaking. The menu is a perfect blend of traditional Italian flavors with a modern twist. A must-visit for anyone looking for a memorable dining experience in Rome."

Imàgo,Rome,4.5,"Centro neighborhood in Rome, with its historical allure, beckons to the culturally curious. The neighborhood is home to the iconic Pantheon, a testament to Rome's ancient grandeur, and the picturesque Piazza Navona, a lively square filled with Baroque masterpieces. The narrow cobblestone streets are lined with an array of trattorias offering traditional Roman dishes, charming gelaterias, and artisan boutiques. With easy access to multiple bus lines and the Metro, Centro makes traversing the Eternal City a breeze. A stay in Centro offers an authentic immersion into Rome's rich tapestry of history, art, and gastronomy."

La Piccola Cuccagna,Rome,4.5,"Young and well-to-do families are the street flavor of Parioli. A new kind of Rome, this area is centuries away from the Renaissance with its pockets of 1930s palaces, tony boutiques, open-air markets and plenty of coffee shops. Parioli was built as an enclave for last century’s haute bourgeois and still represents as such in 21st century Rome. Need a break? The area has several great sporting clubs known for tennis and riding, a wonderful modern art museum, easy access to the zoo (Europe’s oldest), and is nestled around Rome’s very best parks including Villa Borghese, Villa Ada and Villa Glori."

Ristorante La Tavernetta 48,Rome,4.5,Do not sit inside because you will feel like you are in a sarcophagus. And it’s in a dark kind of cramped alley with no view.
Ristorante La Tavernetta 48,Rome,4.5,"I had been to this place maybe 10 years ago and tonight I went back.
It retains the excellent characteristics of that time.
Great food, qualified staff, prepared and welcoming, as well as polite and kind.
Of course I will return.
I highly recommend it!"
Ristorante La Tavernetta 48,Rome,4.5,"On our last visit in Rome we arrived to this hidden gem to have romantic dinner and again the experience exceeded our expectations. Located in the heart of Rome, but quiet and intimate. Inside and outside tables. Perfect personal servise, Englishspeaking staff. So tasty food, good choice for vegetarian. Good wine and coctails list. So happy it still has its class. Very recommended. Enjoy!"
Ristorante La Tavernetta 48,Rome,4.5,Food was okay. Ambience was not great - was raining so no outside tables and the room inside was very cramped and there were gnats flying around all over. The waitress was nice.

Ristorante La Tavernetta 48,Rome,4.5,"After reading several very positive reviews about this restaurant, we went there as a family. What a disappointment...
Nothing Italian on the plate: bland cuisine, without taste or flavor. We really had the impression that this restaurant is only for foreign tourists, which was the case that night.
It is not worth a visit or a reservation.
The only good thing was the service, which was still pleasant.
Go your way."
Ristorante La Tavernetta 48,Rome,4.5,"Walking through the alleys of the center we found ourselves in front of this restaurant with outdoor tables, very cute and inviting
We sat down and ordered
All great, well cooked and fresh raw material
We ate fish and as I repeat everything fresh
Fabulous raw sea bass
Congratulations"
Ristorante La Tavernetta 48,Rome,4.5,"Local a few steps from Piazza Navona. Small environment with very close tables. Corrected the service. Too oily the Roman artichokes, excellent cut of picanha as well as baked potatoes side dish: good larded pork fillet. Fair tiramisu, good panna cotta; just the bill (about 50 € person). 4shltelle plentiful."

The narrow cobblestone streets are lined with an array of trattorias offering traditional Roman dishes, charming gelaterias, and artisan boutiques. With easy access to multiple bus lines and the Metro, Centro makes traversing the Eternal City a breeze. A stay in Centro offers an authentic immersion into Rome's rich tapestry of history, art, and gastronomy."

Osteria Del Cavaliere,Rome,4.6,Very good restaurant close to Piazza Re di Roma. Perfect service and very friendly staff.Very good value for money.
Osteria Del Cavaliere,Rome,4.6,"We stayed at Incanto Chic, a B&B in the center of Sacrofano. The owners are the same as the restaurant Il Cavaliere and we had a great time both in the structure and in the restaurant.
We appreciated the attention to customers, the welcome, the quality of food and the live music that accompanied us throughout the evening.
We took the tasting menu where we could taste the typical specialties of the place and it was all very good.
The great price, 35 € per person!
The location is central in the village and the place is in typical medieval style very nice and 'Inside there is also a very nice cave to see.
If we happen again in Sacrofano we will definitely return! Highly recommended!"
Osteria Del Cavaliere,Rome,4.6,"I was at the Osteria del Cavaliere on a Wednesday evening in November. The room is small but for this very familiar and warm, as well as all the staff members!
We started with the appetizers, all delicious (the fried polentines with amazing cream cheese and pepper), except for the tartare but only because the truffle sauce almost completely covered the flavor of the meat.
The first all fantastic, my favorite pumpkin cream goodies. The main courses of meat are their must: the fantastic shin, but the rib of suckling pig already melted only when cut!
I will gladly come back whenever I find myself in the vicinity!"
Osteria Del Cavaliere,Rome,4.6,"I had the pleasure of dining in this restaurant for two nights during my holiday in Rome and I was thrilled. 
The food is authentic and genuine, just like what Grandma cooked: simple flavors, but rich in tradition and care. 
The atmosphere is warm and intimate, perfect for feeling at home from the first moment. 
Price quality ratio is great, hard to find better. 
A beautiful discovery that I highly recommend and will gladly return to."

This district, a hub for timeless Roman architecture, is home to the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano, a magnificent cathedral that draws the admiration of locals and tourists alike.

Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,On the side of Via Appia is this unforgettable gem. It offers a varied menu that includes dishes typical of ancient Rome. The atmosphere and service are excellent. Highly recommended
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"The best thing is the cozy and well heated place that makes you relax and enjoy the atmosphere.
Good polenta with sprouts and sausages and cherry pie. Excellent Shirah from Marconi winery."
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"Together with colleagues (a group of 28 people) we decided to spend a day in Rome. We stayed at the Vatican and then had lunch at the Hostaria Antica Roma. We were welcomed in the beautiful fireplace room, a warm and comfortable environment, in line with the whole room... The place thrilled everyone! But even more we appreciated the friendliness, helpfulness and sympathy of Paul, who, an expert and scholar of ancient Roman cuisine, brightened the lunch with anecdotes and stories about the place and the menu that offers. The lunch really great. Delicious porchetta and pecorino cheese (the latter exclusive recipe of the restaurant), excellent first courses (which were supposed to be tastings, but which were actually served in abundance) and delicious sausage and arrosticini. Perfect value for money. I will also return with friends and family. I highly recommend it."
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"I had heard about it and we decided to try the re-enactment of the cuisine of ancient Rome. It was a very pleasant experience both for the dishes tasted that take you back in time but also for the hospitality of Chef Paolo who tirelessly illustrated the processes for the reconstruction of this cuisine so ancient and the history of his family and this truly welcoming and magical place.
Also a reading environment with a library with historical texts and art from the classical world."

We wanted to live a unique experience, which would remain as an indelible memory... and so it was. The dazzling beauty of the view of Cecilia Metella's tomb in the welcome drink, the welcome of the rooms, the warmth of the room with the fireplace, the friendliness of the owners, the great food... we were pleased in everything and everything was perfect. Thank you! Francesca"
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"Even if you have no intention of walking along Appian Way, this restaurant is a reason to do it. This was my second visit this year and will certainly return. The food is delicious and the cozy setting could not be more inviting. A good number of the dishes are made according to exact recipes of Ancient Rome and they knew how to eat well back then as well. This is a family run restaurant and the owner/chef takes the time needed to explain the dishes in an entertaining fashion."
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"Put the Sunday before Christmas, warm as if it were almost spring, a tasting of dishes inspired by ancient Rome, the real one, plus the sympathy, experience and historical-archaeological but also comic tales of Paul who is truly one of a kind! If you want to eat superbly and get passionate, this is the place for you, the word of a new loyal customer!"
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"Fantastic restaurant, went there at night and it was all lit up like a fairyland playground. Was personally greeted by the owner who chatted with me and helped me order. Delicious food was followed by an enticing dessert, The restaurant was surrounded by park like grounds containing beautiful statuary . While there, as I was coming up the long, winding path, I felt the presence of someone right behind me, then they came up on my right side and as they were passing me, I glanced to my right and nobody was there! Right before that a black cat ran hissing, spitting and growling along my left side and passed me with a small roar of a major hiss. It was running as fast as it could and passed me right before my otherworldly visitor came up on my right. I think I felt the presence of a ghost that dark night at the Osteria! What a strange experience..."
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"Dear Mary Ellen,
thank you very much for your wonderful and vividly written review. It truly made us smile.

The Via Appia Antica has been welcoming travelers, soldiers, poets, pilgrims—and the occasional mysterious presence—for more than 2,000 years. So yes, it is quite possible that you were greeted by one of our very benevolent resident ghosts, who still enjoy strolling the paths at night and making sure guests feel… properly welcomed.

As for the black cat, we can confirm he is very much alive, officially in charge of night patrols, and occasionally a little dramatic—especially when surprised by unseen colleagues from the past.

We are delighted that you enjoyed the atmosphere, the food, the dessert, and the conversation. The magic you felt is part of what makes this place special: history, nature, good food, and a touch of mystery—all living peacefully together.

We hope to welcome you again soon. Who knows… perhaps next time the ghosts will join you at the table—quietly and politely, of course.

Warm regards,

Paolo Magnanimi"
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"In a beautiful villa facing the mausoleum of Cecilia Metella is located this distinguished restaurant. Excellent cuisine and convivial environment, the owner provides nice anecdotes of ancient Roman recipes and guests of the local."
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,La ringraziamo di cuore per le sue parole: siamo felici che la sua esperienza sia stata piacevole.
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"A long anticipated Anniversary Dinner disappointment. The location is quite special, the interior quite charming. My husband arranged for a little flower arrangement
for our table next to an impressive fireplace adorned with everything autumn. There was a large table of dinners, apparently a gourmet group next to us. The host showered his attention on this group and when it came to us we were pretty much ignored. Dinner was fine, nothing remarkable. I ordered dessert and it was awful. overly sweet and I couldn't eat it. No offer for something else, or an offer for coffee. The dessert was deducted from our bill but just being ignored ruined our Anniversary Celebration for me."
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"Dear Madam,
thank you sincerely for sharing your experience, and I am truly sorry that your anniversary dinner did not meet your expectations. Such an important occasion deserves care and attention, and it saddens me to know that it did not feel that way for you.

Allow me, with the utmost respect, to offer some clarification.

The dessert you tasted is the Cassata of Oplontis, a recipe that is more than 2,000 years old, reconstructed from archaeological and historical sources. It is an ancient Roman dessert, intentionally rich in honey, and I completely understand that its original flavor may not suit all modern palates. For this reason, as soon as I learned that you did not enjoy it, I removed it from your bill and asked whether you would prefer something else, hoping to make up for the inconvenience.

Regarding the attention in the dining room, I always try to be present for all guests without being intrusive—especially on a private and intimate occasion such as a wedding anniversary. To make your evening more special, I had prepared our most romantic table by the fireplace, along with the flower arrangement your husband requested.

I am truly sorry that, despite these gestures, you felt overlooked in any way. It was never my intention, and it pains me that this impression affected your celebration.

I would be pleased to welcome you again and offer you an experience that reflects the care, hospitality, and warmth we strive to provide every day. It is my duty—and my genuine wish—to make things right.

With respect and sincere regret,
Paolo Magnanimi"
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,"To celebrate the confirmation of our son with family members we chose this restaurant that we already knew.
The place is obviously very nice is characteristic for the location next to the Cecilia Metella Mausoleum. 
The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming.
We ate in the Goethe Room in front of the burning fireplace. 
Paolo is very helpful and friendly, and at the same time very professional, the dad Massimo very kind. 
All our guests were very satisfied with both the menu and the place. 
We couldn't have made a better choice."
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,Very welcoming and particular place. Roman cuisine menu with dishes also different from the usual. The owner is a real star.
Hostaria Antica Roma,Rome,4.6,È ’na gioia leggere che ve siete trovati bene. L’Hostaria ve aspetta a braccia aperte.

A beautiful setting, wonderful hospitality, and fantastic food.

Thanks Nicola and his Brother....

Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"On a recent business trip to Serbia, my colleague unearthed this fantastic hidden gem of a restaurant—tucked away in a spot that feels like a total secret. The entrance might throw you off at first glance, but push through the doors and treat yourself to some incredible Mediterranean-inspired cuisine! The starters and mains were all absolutely delicious, and with a few beers each to round things out, the total came to just £24 per head. If you're ever in Belgrade, don't skip this place—it's a must!"
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"Good food, easy locar, nice service. The place with the Mediterranean menu is probably more intended for summer dining with friends, but it worked in the cold fall too."
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"Not delicious, not worth that money. The food is not delicious.. and there's nothing to write... I don't know how they gave the restaurant a star.. the portions are beautiful and that's it."
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"Really Good food and atmosphere 
The concept of order is making it easy and interactive. 
The food was delicious for respecting prices, service was really nice. 
Recommend it 100%"
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,The Mezestoran is an outstanding restaurant located centrally in Belgrade. We had a fabulous family meal at a very reasonable price. The staff were excellent. They were warm welcoming and very helpful. The food was West first class and the Greek wine delightful. Many thanks to all the staff for offering us such a lovely evening.
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"We dined twice in this restaurant during our stay. It is a warm and typical local place. The starters and dishes are excellent. The ingredients are quality and the cuisine offered original and tasty. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. 
The value for money is quite reasonable.
We recommend"
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"We had an amazing dinner at Mezestoron in Belgrade. From the moment we walked in, we were warmly welcomed by the host and staff, who were all incredibly kind, professional, and attentive. Our waiter was exceptional and made sure everything was perfect throughout the evening. The food was absolutely delicious — every dish was full of flavor and beautifully presented.

Thank you for a truly wonderful evening — we’ll definitely be coming back!"
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"Visited this cozy restaurant with nice and warm interior. Staff is very polite and friendly, helpful with dishes and the food is really tasty and homemade.
Keep doing in that way."
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"The food is really nice and the atmosphere is beautiful.

On the negative side, we waited too long to have the meals served and they were not served at the same time.
Additionally, the portion of the main dish, filled aubergine, was delicious but really too small for the main dish. Should be at least double the size.

House wine is nice, we can recommend it.

This is not the first time we came here, usually we enjoy nice atmosphere friendly and professional staff, and delicious food."
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,Lovely hidden spot. Great outdoor seating area. Perfext for summer nights. The food was good and the service was quick. If you are looking for a greek restaurant in Belgrade-check this out.
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"The people of the Mediterranean should fill the faces of the owners of the place and the kitchen team. The serving is terribly delayed, the dishes are undercooked, oversalted and over-dressed with vinegar. The team is slow."
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"This restaurant has a sophisticated causal atmosphere with the spirit of Greece. 

 The food was extraordinary; very tasty and delicious . The service was impeccable !

 I highly recommend this establishment"
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars (their average rating…) but I can’t so I gave them 5 stars because the food was great. The service was lacking - staff were friendly but it took a long time e to get anyone to acknowledge us or bring us a menu or come to take our order… so come for the food but expect the service might not be as good as one would expect from a really good restaurant.
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"Everything was perfect. The staff, the atmosphere, everything was so relaxed. And the was delicious, as always. Tnank you and bravo!"
Mezestoran Dvorište,Beograd,4.7,"The croutons in the Cretan salad were very hard, and the cucumbers were not peeled, resulting in an unpleasant taste. The shrimp pasta was also underwhelming, as both the shrimp and the sauce lacked flavor. Additionally, the squid was rubbery, making the overall meal less enjoyable."

Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"Unlimited tasting experience in Mexico restaurants of Belgrade, the special place with South American style, green color plants, good taste"
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"The food, atmosphere and appearance is good. Our food came in two parts. There was more than 10 minutes in between so one had cold food and the other half was still hot! Strange that you can't serve 2 dishes at the same time! Didn't find the portion s that big either. I’m not a big eater and my plate was empty!)"
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,Great place for a delicious dinner. We ordered the set set and couldn't finish it. I didn't expect there to be so many dishes :) Nice waiters and relaxing atmosphere.
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"This restaurant is exellent, perfect for couples, food is autentic mexican. Great expirience. Stuff are hospotable, food is fresh and restaurant is very clean. Nice ambient."
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"This Mexican restaurant is a true gem, especially when it comes to their margaritas. The vibrant and authentic flavors transport you to a fiesta with every sip. The extensive margarita menu offers something for every taste preference. The ambiance complements the experience perfectly, creating a lively and enjoyable atmosphere. A definite recommendation for margarita enthusiasts seeking an authentic and flavorful dining experience."
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"We decided to celebrate the New Year in this restaurant. From the first minute the impressions began to deteriorate! I had to wait outside for more than 30 minutes to get in, considering that all the tables were paid for, since outerwear was accepted for a fee. For more than an hour, there was nothing on the table except alcohol and water, not even a chair for the children to sit separately. The menu has changed dramatically, which was agreed in advance and did not correspond to reality. We constantly asked and waited for appetizers/main courses, everyone ended up hungry. It felt like we ended up getting cold leftovers from the kitchen. The impression was that the attitude towards foreigners was disdainful, and the local population was indifferent to the quality of service and food. We paid €92 per person and, in my opinion, I have never seen worse service."
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"Paid €460 for new years (5 people/ 6 tickets and here is what we got:
 ⁃ Menu completely changed last minute without any notice
 ⁃ We never got what we ordered and we got what we didn’t order. Also waited for that food for a really long time
 ⁃ We had to keep asking so many times for food, drinks, chair etc 
 ⁃ We never got sea bass and mushrooms that was pre-ordered from fast menu. Also never got dessert, which was included, but our waitress said that we need to pay extra for that
 ⁃ We got three main dishes to share for 5 of us and it was cold, it felt like we just got the leftovers from kitchen or whatever they had available.
 ⁃ Huge line outside the door"
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"Amazing place with awesome atmosphere. Very well recommended. Food, drinks and staff are perfect. Authentic Mexican place in the city"
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,Wont serve you if youre a foreigner (maybe just specifically americans) see picture for example of food/drink to expect
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"Amazing atmosphere and very nice cocktails. Our host Jowan was very polite and recommended us the best cocktails. I personally liked the Solarita a lot. The love music made our evening complete, thanks! 10/10 would recommend."
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"Based on the great reviews, my daughter and I walked from the city center to this restaurant (about 45 minutes). The food was pretty good - although huge portions! I was surprised the fajitas didn’t include the flour wraps, but they can be ordered separately. Service was good and it has a very nice atmosphere. 

What really detracted from the experience was trying to enjoy a dinner with my 11 year old daughter and being completely surrounded by smokers who lit up one cigarette after another. Yes, it’s allowed in Belgrade but I’ll never understand why restaurants in 2023 - in ANY country- don’t have a non-smoking section so non-smokers and children aren’t forced to inhale second hand smoke when eating. Yuck. We left having barely finished our meals.

This is likely a bigger issue than this restaurant, but I will gladly take my business somewhere that can offer a more pleasant atmosphere for everyone- not just smokers.. there are a few options in Belgrade!"
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"Amazing food, been here 5 times and cannot be happier. One of Belgrade’s best restaurants. Everyone loved the food and the service. Deserves a michelin star!"
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"We had a family lunch , and it was perfect. They were very polite and because we had a lot of the kids who don’t like spicy food they created Mexican dishes suitable for them. We had a lot of different meals and everything was really tasty especially the prawns.

We will surely add this place on the list for our lunch/dinners."
Buena Vida Mexican Gastrobar,Beograd,4.7,"Great food, terrible, incompetent service. Waiters were painfully slow, they served starters together with half of the main, without bringing cutlery."

7 unforgettable flavors matched by 7 indigenous Syrbistan wines; the harmonious wine and dishes are so high, and the plates are truly creative. High-aromatic sweet-wine breeze served with sweet match. The most delicious pairing is the sharp pairing of our cherry with high body cherry.
The presentation is in English and we were very pleased with the service."

We wanted to photograph every detail on the plates. It was a true art. The menu was created based on the number of products. The plates in line were delightful. The wines to accompany every plate were hand-selected. Point shot matches. Thank you so much for giving us this experience. The lady who served us was very experienced and courteous. Pricing policy matched service. I think such an experience will be paid for. I hope it stays that quality."

Enso,Beograd,4.7,"Enso deserves it’s Michelin recommendation, but our experience was very mixed. 

The restaurant itself is fairly small with a modern, trendy interior. We decided to order from the a la carte menu so we could try as many items as possible between the two of us and not be limited by the tasting menu. 

I will start by saying the food is absolutely fantastic. Between the two of us, we ordered a large portion of the menu and every course seemed to be better than the last, and all of them were excellent. The food quality, inventiveness and presentation are deserving of at least one Michelin star in our opinion. I would fly back to Belgrade just to eat here. 

Enso has one major issue they need to solve. Serbia still allows smoking in restaurants and we had smokers next to us and behind us. The tables are very close together so you will be affected by the smoke from other diners. The restaurant was full of smoke and the staff attempted to open the door to allow in some fresh air; only to be scolded by some diners who complained about the draft. 
They then turned up the air conditioning to try and remove some of the smoke, but it remained an issue. Enso needs to at least try to seat all the smokers together. I’m sure the food would have tested even better if it didn’t have the extra “Marlboro Spice” . 

The other issue we had was with the service. Our server (Jelena) was pleasant enough, but not as polished as one would expect from a restaurant at this level. She only brought one of our main entrees and never brought the other. When we were finally able to get her attention, she wanted to argue with us stating we had only ordered one main and that if we wanted a second, it would “only “ be an additional twenty-five minute wait. We received no apology and no attempt to correct the situation. At this point, it was late, we reeked of smoke and just wanted to remember the amazing food and not the poor service. 

Overall, the chef at Enso should be celebrated. The food is fantastic. Hopefully they can work on the ambience and service issues."
Enso,Beograd,4.7,"Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. Your praise for the inventiveness and presentation means a lot to our team.

We sincerely apologize for the issues you faced with the smoke and service during your visit. We understand how important a comfortable dining atmosphere is, and we are actively working on solutions to improve this aspect for our guests. Your comments regarding the service are also noted, and we will address this with our staff to ensure better communication and attentiveness in the future.

Thank you again for your valuable insights. We hope to welcome you back soon for an even better experience.

Kind regards

Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,This is a “grastronomic” address in Belgrade. Especially for sea food. The service is impeccable. A special mention for the shell-less scampi that were served raw with a delicate sauce. Absolutely exceptional. Worth the trip. The best scampi I ever tasted.
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,This was the third time we went to legat . We are from the Netherlands but every time we are in Serbia we just have to go to legat . It’s our favorite restaurant in this part or Europe. Great food great service really friendly staff.
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"We attended a wedding in Serbia and the restaurant was used both for the ceremony and the dinner.

The food was spectacular, and the ambiance exquisite.

We highly recommend the place as the service was superb and the chef created amazing combinations"
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"Great food, excellent service. Nice atmosphere. The best staff in town.
My favourites - fish, octopus salad, foie gras"
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"beautiful food and service, very pleasant space, you can feel at home because the service is very pleasant"
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"beautiful food and service, very pleasant space, you can feel at home because the service is very pleasant"
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"We booked for dinner. Service and dishes of excellent quality and above all very generous portions. We paid €90 in total with two starters, a first course, a second course and two glasses of wine plus water"
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"We found this restaurant on the Michelin list, and wanted to try it during our visit to Belgrade. We wanted to try a 7 cours experience for 5.500 dinars per pers. When we came and checked the menu, there was a complitely another menu for 8.500 dinars per pers. We were surprised and showed the waitress the home page menu. She said that it was the old one, and that we could talk with the restaurant Manager. He came with a shocking explanation that they havent the access to their home page, that tje reason was some external and internal factors (???), and that they cant do anything about it. He also said that they want us to be sutissfied, and that they will make some menu for the home page menu. I told him that we came for the experiance, which was already ruined by this surprise. He told me that I did not listened to him (??) about not having the access to their home page. I told him that it was a terrible excuse for the restaurant which is on Michellin list. We left the restaurant emediatelly. We hope that Michelin inspectors will remove this restaurant from their list, because it does not belong there."
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"It was a nice venue although lacking in atmosphere because it was largely empty. The tasting menu whilst nothing wrong with it was unimaginative and lacking in wow factor. The staff were pleasant and efficient. The wine pairing was good and well constructed. 
The bill was good value for a Michelin star restaurant but then I was slightly surprised it had one."
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"I’m fortunate to have eaten in a number of five star and Michelin restaurants around the world and whilst there was nothing wrong with our meal last night, there was nothing special about it either. The fact that the main course was roast chicken speaks volumes about the imagination and originality of the tasting menu. It was fine but nothing different or unusual.

The venue was lovely and the staff were very friendly but the fact that we only saw around 10 other diners during the whole time we were there suggests we are not alone in our view. For a Saturday night, that cannot be good news."
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"A great ambience, relaxing and friendly staff, and a great menu. We chose the tasting menu and were not disappointed. Whilst the dishes were both both regional and classical, Legat 1903 delivers. Well cooked food, nicely balanced and presented with an excellent wine pairing in a relaxed environment it’s definitely worth a visit. Highly recommended."
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"Interior is great and service is very professional. But! For the restaurant with the Michelin recommendation, food was not so good. It is on average level that you can meet in many 'ordinary' restaurants."
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"Overpriced for Serbia, rude parking attendant. Had eaten here before and food was good, but menu had changed, they discontinued everything on menu that was mid-range price. Everything is now extremely expensive. Due to this experience and the behavior of parking attendant we will not return. We were really surprised at his unprofessional and rude conduct."
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"What a restaurant . It’s fine dining at it’s best with a rich menu , nice location chic romantic business restaurant . Top Food with Top service in a Top Place . A big Applause Legat 1903"
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,"All praise, one of the best restaurants in Belgrade. Luxurious interior, quiet music, excellent service, perfect food and an excellent selection of wines. I would gladly recommend the restaurant ""Legat 1903"" to my friends. Thank you again for your excellent service!"
Legat 1903,Beograd,4.5,I dined at Legat 1903 on a trip to Belgrade. The decor is very nice indeed and they had a singing pianist which really made the evening. A fabulous tasting menu with excellent service to go with it. Highly recommended.

Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"A lovely place to unwind, have a cocktail or a coffee with a delicious slice of cake."
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"For the 7th time in Belgrade, we went to this place. We usually stay at the Moskva Hotel, so we have breakfast, always excellent to the sound of the piano. The restaurant in the evening is excellent it remains a must in Belgrade.
This year we were just passing through one day, we just wanted to have an aperitif around 5pm before returning, always nice, the setting did not move, we were even invited by the waiter to repatriate us inside because of the bad weather. So far everything is in line with the excellence of the place but when paying, for the first time, we were clearly asked ""how much do you tip?"" I find it rude, rude, vulgar and totally inappropriate for a place of such a high standing. Especially since we always leave something. So the Directorate please, if you read this notice, change this practice, give instructions to your staff"
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"This place had excellent food and deserts. It is a little more expensive than a regular restaurant, but well-worth it. I would definitely eat here again."
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"We stayed at Hotel Moskva for 3 nights. Their buffet breakfast at this cafe was good with a variety of choices. However, dinner wasn’t that good. Yes, it was innovative and picture worthy but definitely lacking in flavor. Also, we had gone back on our last night to try their famous Schnitte cake. Not only were we disappointed with the taste, the service was appallingly disappointing! There were at least 4 waiters within our proximity and they simply ignored us. What’s with that? They are in the hospitality business and they didn’t bother to please their customers! I would never go back here."
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,This is a very upscale hotel with a lovely atmosphere. They have a nice area to enjoy coffee and delicious cakes and drinks. At times they have a pianist performing with lovely music.
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"""Tchaikovsky Hall"" of Hotel Moskva - ideal space and unforgettable service"
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"""Tchaikovsky Hall"" of Hotel Moskva - ideal space and unforgettable service

After looking for a space (it took more than a month) in the wider part of the center of Belgrade where we would organize our son's wedding for about 20-30 guests, we were pleasantly surprised that the renowned Hotel Moskva has just such a space and service.

It is about the freshly restored ""CHAIKOVSKY HALL WITH FIREPLACE ROOM"", for guests who prefer intimate celebrations (weddings, baptisms, banquets, business events, etc.) and who require a separate space, a relaxed atmosphere similar to ""home"".
In contrast to the 8 spaces (renowned restaurants and hotels) we looked at, the concept provided by the ""Tchaikovsky Hall"" is incomparable: a separate space with ""French Louis eneterier"", natural ventilation and a toilet, allows complete intimacy and relaxation in the very center of Belgrade.

The food is high-quality, fresh, abundant enough, tasty and prepared according to the highest gastronomic standards (combination of local and French cuisine). Meat, fish and vegetarian menu sets without fail, so that even the biggest hedonists (and almost everyone present was that in their own way) could not find the slightest complaint. One guest, a well-known lawyer from London, summed up her impression as follows: ""I have almost never seen such a symbiosis of interior, food and service"".
At the same time, the ""price of the service"" is quite measured and acceptable, considering the overall quality of the service provided to us.

The waiters are rarely professional, decent, cultured, as if they were part of our family.

However, above all, we were surprised by the professionalism of Jovana Jovović (Sales Coordinator), who organized it all. I am almost 70 years old, I have stayed for business and privately in dozens of prestigious hotels around the world and in all renowned restaurants and hotels in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but I have not had the opportunity to meet such commitment to work and clients, decency, helpfulness and trust that radiates from Jovana Jovović.

All in all, respect for Hotel Moskva and its staff, with whom we spent time on January 29 of this year."
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"Fine dining, fine menu, nice location, piano live music, a fine atmosphere with good staff, I wooul like to come back"
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"Dear P3664GRdanielm, 
Thank you for your review, we are glad to here you enjoyed our service and atmosphere. 
We are looking forward to host you again.

Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"I went here with a friend during summer, and we ended up buying a late breakfast here. The food was great, and the atmosphere even greater. Even the decorations and the place itself was beautiful. The staff was very professional, and the food came rather quickly."
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"Dear Jecxax, 
Thank you so much for sharing your positive experience with others. We are very pleased you enjoyed our high quality dishes made by carefully chosen ingredients and convenient location. Once again thank you for your review and visiting us.
Many regards from all of us!

Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"Went there with family and colleagues, service was extremely slow. Waiter approached us 20 minutes after we first sat. We ordered, waited 1 hour for drinks and another 30 minutes for our burgers to arrive (15e per burger), only to receive it cold. 15e for cold burger is a disgrace. I don’t blame the waiters tho, this place is horribly understaffed! Employe more people if you charge that much!
Never going there again."

We hope that the misgiving experienced will not hinder you from considering visit us again as we look forward to welcoming you back to the Hotel Moskva and restauran Tchaikovsky in the nearest future, to regain your confidence in our service.
Sincerely yours,

Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"This restaurant located Terazije square is at a prime location and the oldest operating hotel in city since 1906. Beautiful ambience and great food. We ordered vegan burger, risottoand grape wine. The food was great and vegetarian options were available."
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"I have been rather disappointed on the quality of the food. I had Beef tartare as cold starter and what was supposed to be Risotto with smoked duct breast.
I probably got food poisoning due to the beef tartare which was not served cold and fresh. 
The risotto was really not good. It was crispy - not cooked enough - and bot at all creamy! 

So disappointed"
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"I often have my evening meal at the Hotel Moscow since the atmosphere and cuisine is unmatched in the city centre. I eat out every night, and this hotel has by far the most refined experience:

From 6 to 8pm there's a pianist playing really nice tunes and this really adds to the atmosphere. The waiters are top notch, and the wine selection is always excellent. So in this hotel they offer the best Serbian wines and they match the cuisine well. 

The kitchen has a new chef apparently, and the food is rich and tasty."
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"Nice place to have a glass of wine, champagne, afternoon tea....they have a big choice of cakes and sweets. 
I will say the prices for Serbia are not cheap but the location is worth it. 
The service was nice and polite. 

The service was nice and polite. 
I picked the cake made under the name of the hotel, according to the hotel
Is unique in the world.... not bad but not amazing.. must be because i’m chocoholic"
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,We heard about the history of this hotel on a free walking tour and came back for the famous Moscow cake (and others) and coffee. It is a little more spendy then other cafes but surprisingly affordable. The quality of the coffee and cakes were great and the ambiance very special. Service was good. Lovely history/ A nice place to spend an hour.
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"Lovely coffe while listening piano play in background , had tastyest breakfast sandwich ever, traditional and well visited place by all generations"
Restaurant Tchaikovsky,Beograd,4.3,"Great restaurant and great location. It was easy to find it since it is located in the city center. Delicious and tasty food, served by highly pleasant staff. I recommend this place to all who need a quiet and comfortable place for having lunch with your family."

Ambar,Beograd,4.6,By mistake the review i wrote for ambar is for madera restaurant. I really appologize for the mistake please dont publish it thanks
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,האם נדרש להזמין מקום מראש לטרוחת ערב? צפויים לבקר בה בין 12-15 באפריל .
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"It was pretty, we went family, we said tasting menu, the flavors were good, Turkish dish was perfectly suited to tasting menu, you can request your desired food again without any additional cost. The ambience is pretty friendly and they understand clean English and I think it’s a place to choose"
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"A nice restaurant with good food, excellent service, and a warm, inviting atmosphere. 
It was a very nice stop on our walking tour around the river.
The place is very cosy and in good location The food was good with couple of tasty dishes the staff were friendly and attentive. recommended"
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"We came to Ambar after reading countless glowing reviews, expecting a special dining experience with their “all you can eat” menu. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the most disappointing meals of our trip.
The dishes arrived in a messy order, many of them were dry, poorly prepared, and simply not tasty. It felt as if the food was brought out just to tick a box, without any real care or attention.
Even after we told the waitress that we barely touched most of the dishes, no one tried to understand what went wrong or offer any kind of solution.
After seeing so many positive reviews, we expected something completely different. Sadly, it was far from it.
We won’t be coming back, and we definitely can’t recommend it."
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"Definitely the best place in town.
Excellent service, excellent food, and we will always be happy to return.
I would especially single out the location, with a beautiful view of the river."
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"Our Trafalgar group had its Farewell Dinner here on Oct 11. Beautiful setting on the river, an old warehouse refurbished into a wonderful restaurant. I had a delicious soup, lovely tomato and cucumber salad, amazing sausage and fries and then chocolate cake. Everything was great including the service and atmosphere."
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"Great waterfront restaurant, delicious food, great Service, important to reserve.. it was very busy.

We enjoyed different dishes... and all were very good.. partly reinterpreted like the well-known grilled peppers.. you also have the possibility to eat them at a great price through the menu (about 30 -35 euros p. P without drinks)"
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"Poor Service,
The food worst we ate during our stay in Belgrade.
Arrogant staff
Small portions 
And not worth the money.
Had high expectations but unfortunately nothing I can recommend."
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,Very delicious and varied menu. We chose the unlimited menu and loved it. Somewhat expensive for Serbian standards but still absolutely top!
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"We arrive that the place was not at all crowded, very few presences. Let's order two seconds and a side dish.
One of the main courses, a fried chicken, arrives almost immediately. Time goes by and the rest of the food doesn't show. It is good practice for diners to eat together, I understand that it is difficult to deliver 10 courses together but there were two of us and we ordered three dishes. 
I wait more than 5 minutes, during which obviously the food was cooling, I look for the waiter but he was busy chatting in the kitchen (open kitchen, so all visible). Alche I get up and go to the register to report. He apologizes and goes to check. After several minutes the appetizer arrives and then others pass by to have the Third Party dish. Needless to say, in the meantime my chicken had totally cooled off. I report the discontent and the waiter tells me that the food comes out when it is ready. Okay, so make sure it's ready for everyone at the same time, not in stages. 
Good food, thankfully.
Let's order coffee. I have time to go to the bathroom, come back, wait, observe the staff who should make our coffee mind their business with their cellphone, and we decide to go and ask at the counter. The waiter had forgotten...I wonder what happens when the place is full. Of course I won't find out because they won't see me again."
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"Amazing experience. Small plates, big laughs. The food was amazing, really flavorful. A tad bit more expensive, but actually a very reasonable price for the quality. Would recommend all the way if you want a proper gastro experience of Serbian cousine."

He was a slave to our expectations. Very expensive for Serbia. Arrogant waiters. Do not specify small or big portion on the menu. Although we finished eating, it didn't even take our dirty plates from the front until we paid."
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"Not very busy for lunch, but had a great table outside (we were still cool). Service by Ivica was effortlessly, the (partly shared) food was fresh and very nice. Ivica's suggestion to try a local white wine: Blejk Chichateau was suprising. Good lunch had by all!"
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,Nice food in very small portions The space outside full of insects on the ceiling
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,The food tastefully was very careful but it was very small in quantity and the price quite sour. For families with children I would not recommend it. The location of the tables outside with insects on the ceiling something that became tedious after they fell on our plates
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,"The ambiance, food, waitress , view all was excellent. Although little less options for Veggie persons but whatever they have were really good"
Ambar,Beograd,4.6,We had dinner by the river experiencing a serbian menu that had almost everything! And tasty! I think the beef carpaccio was the best

Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"Tripadvisor is not responsible for this summary or the opinions in it. For more information, please read the traveler reviews and learn more about how the site works."
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"The downside of this restaurant is that they smoke here. The main pros are great service, fast meals, live music, large portions and delicious food"
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"Their food was excellent, but not perfect. The communications were very weak and not taken care of. The vibe is so beautifully self-sufficient. There were individual players on every floor and section. Music starts after 9 p.m. We had a Reservation for 8:00, but we thought we'd cancel until the music started. The gamers who came to our floor were friendly and entertained.
I don’t choose again because there was a non-cozy attitude."
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,Very large and a bit dark (you can hardly see the dishes). Service so fast and quick that they brought us appetizers and meat dishes all together. Already not hot we ate them almost cold. The equally cold crepe is undercooked. There are better restaurants
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"While in Belgrade it was almost compulsory to have a dinner in the Skardarlija Quarter at Dva Jelena (Two Deers, established in 1832) – a HUGE multi level restaurant. ‘They’ say that the Serbian national salad is MEAT! We had plenty to eat, with a drink of ‘rocket fuel’ (Rakija) to start with. We were warned that it could be smoky – the locals love to smoke, however we ended up down & around & down in a private dining room, (Flambe) with drinks, food & music – and NO SMOKE. Good service, food, great music & singer."
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"This hostess is driving customers away and is a complete liability to the business. We traveled from Greece with a reservation made a week in advance, yet no one bothered to mention a ""dress code."" It’s honestly laughable; we have visited the most high-end restaurants across Europe and were always treated with respect, yet this outdated place in Belgrade had an issue with us being ""well-dressed.""
Even after we were seated, the hostess approached us with an incredibly aggressive and rude attitude. She showed zero respect for a member of our party recovering from surgery, staying hostile and dismissive. It’s a joke to judge guests so inconsistently when other people inside were poorly dressed. Her toxic behavior ruins the restaurant's reputation. Save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere."
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"The location and long-standing reputation of this restaurant are not in question. However, non-smokers should avoid it. Friendly staff and good food cannot compensate for the overwhelming cigarette smoke. I believe the experience is much more pleasant in the summer, when sitting outside in the garden.

The space is very small, and tables are simply declared as smoking or non-smoking, without any physical separation. In reality, the entire restaurant is filled with cigarette smoke.

For a non-smoker, having lunch or dinner here feels like inhaling the equivalent of a full pack of cigarettes per meal, making it impossible to enjoy the atmosphere of a traditional old Belgrade restaurant. This place is clearly suitable only for smokers.

It is especially not recommended for families or couples with children."
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"This used to be a bohemian restaurant, but now is a place of horror where several bands interfere each other, food is overpriced and at doors you have peasant girls with no manners. It's sad to see what DvaJelena became."
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"Very disappointing experience ⭐
We arrived in two and were told that we could not sit at a table of four “because it was reserved for 4 people”, even though there were many free tables. A few minutes later, however, the same table was given to a male-female couple.
We felt discriminated against and treated with little courtesy. In a self-respecting restaurant, all customers should be welcomed with equal regard, regardless of who they are or who they show up with. We were welcomed by a blonde girl who was completely unprofessional. A little respect and professionalism was enough to avoid a bad figure. The restaurant, gentlemen, is another story. Learn to hire the right people. I've been traveling for years something like this never happened anywhere in the world. A city like Belgrade cannot have this representation. SHAME ON YOU."
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"Not good! 
Slow service and the tasty not very good. The typical Pljeskavlca taste industrial meat. I had in anotehet place really good."
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"we arrived around 730 on a monday night, and it was already crowded, they stuck us in the far back with all the tourists at a table with absolutely no leg room whatsover. The ribs we ordered were luke warm to cold, ,, the service was terrible. Ive been to Dva jelena once before five years ago, during the day when there were no people and the service and food were good.. But this time, the food was absolutely terrible,, I paid $125 for a terrible dinner.. was a waste of money"
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"Great location, great value, great food, great portions genuine and local. Really recommend this gem in Belgrade"
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"Huge place with several levels; we were taken to a dark lower level. The food is traditional Serbian fare, with lots of meat. We had chicken, kebabs, burgers, potatoes, and cake. All too much!"
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"As tourists we took a walk down the street and accidentally went into this restaurant, turned to the waiter asking for a table for 4 people she pointed to a certain table, we started to settle down, (I notice we don't know Serbian - communication in English) , another completely waiter comes up to us and asks us if we were spared the table, we said ""no"" as soon as we came in and he told us in reply that we can't sit at this table, but we tell him that it's our vessels directed by the waiters (he abruptly stopped speaking in English) and passed by that waiter and we spared him and he said that he directed us to this table, we sat down and opened the menu but the menu unfortunately in Serbian and it's hard for us, we decided to check if they had a menu in English, one of several old people (waiters) passed by we respectfully called him to ask a question to which he waved off and looked rudely at us, we said we only wanted to ask a question to which he rudely answered wait for his waiter and then we were carried, I was in many restaurants in Serbia but this one is not worth it!! Within 5 minutes I felt owed someone a favor to wait and beg....sorry ...but this isn't a restaurant this is a diner!!!!"
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"We went as a family of four looking forward to a nice dinner based on reviews from previous visitors and from pictures from the website. Two family members ordered steaks which was highly recommended by the waiter. Another order chicken filet and lastly one ordered ox check with mashed potatoes. On the side we ordered two different salads and grilled vegetables. We waited for a while and seeing the food we realised why: the meat were grilled to more than well done. Like seriously well done! The steaks were completely grey, dry, and nearly impossibly to chew. The chicken filet was equally uneatable as it heavily overcooked and dry like cardboard! Salads looked like they had been chopped yesterday including a quarter of a lemon that was totally dried up on the outside. The potato was close to cold. All in all a really disappointing experience. On the plus side the waiter was very polite. We left 2/3 of our dishes and he apologised on behalf of the kitchen and came with cakes to share. We will NOT recommend the restaurant. At least not dishes with meat. If you decide to try it anyway - then make sure to be very specific about how you want your meat prepared."
Dva Jelena The Two Deer Restaurant,Beograd,4.0,"Great choice 
In the center of Belgrade, in a characteristic area, a stop for a great typical lunch. 
Clean room, friendly and caring staff, generous portions and very good quality"

Restoran Ciribu Ciriba,Beograd,4.7,"Is it possible to book a table somehow? I sent a message to email, but nobody replied("
Restoran Ciribu Ciriba,Beograd,4.7,It's very nice place to have dinner and some rest and it is very good food and lifestyle of time and just very good friends and their are all very good
Restoran Ciribu Ciriba,Beograd,4.7,"Thank you for review. We don't understand why the rating is 3 if the food is nice and good place?

We wish you all the best."
Restoran Ciribu Ciriba,Beograd,4.7,"We went to Ćiribu Ćiriba for lunch on my last day of this visit to Serbia. In fact we had intended to go to a different restaurant but found that it was closed on Mondays. Ćiribu Ćiriba was a lucky discovery! It is a fine restaurant in the centre of Zemun, in a splendid old building with old pictures of the town and artefacts to match. There was a very pleasant atmosphere about the place.

The menu offers a much eider range of traditional Serbian dishes than many other restaurants. As soon as we arrived we were offered a spoonful of slatko, a Serbian tradition that I have experienced in private homes before but not in a restaurant. For my main course I had sarma, meat wrapped in pickled cabbage leaves, which was delicious. We didn't have time for a dessert and didn't want rakija, wine or beer as we had some other things to do before my flight back to the UK later in the afternoon. However, we will certainly return for a fuller meal on my next visit which I hope will be next spring.

The waiter was very pleasant and helpful, and willing to engage with my limited knowledge of the Serbian language which I really appreciated. By the way, the curious name of the restaurant means something like ""abracadabra"". It was a truly magical experience!"
Restoran Ciribu Ciriba,Beograd,4.7,"Typical and picturesque restaurant at the same time. Very Good Welcoming. The restaurant room and its covered terrace charmed us. 
We feasted and at a more than reasonable price. The slatk spoon at the beginning of the meal as tradition and the very well dressed and charming waiters. 
Too bad we got mixed up with the smokers..."
Restoran Ciribu Ciriba,Beograd,4.7,"A really interesting restaurant with a super interesting menu, lots of local choices. I had a Serbian wine which was great and a stuffed chicken, the portion was certainly plentiful!"

Madera,Beograd,4.3,"Very professional Welcoming and server
The meat dish a delight as our starter and dessert 
It's the second time we've come and still as good"
Madera,Beograd,4.3,Had occasional visit there with family and friends. Tried only limonades/tea/coffee and desserts. Absolutely satisfied. Will consider visiting again whenever happen to be nearby.
Madera,Beograd,4.3,"It used to be a much better restaurant. It seems that the prices have almost doubled within one year and the service has gone down. Now it is very overpriced and not worth it. If you sit in the garden it's nice on a nice summer night, but when we were there the garden was closed, and inside it's like an ordinary restaurant. Overall, now it's very overpriced and not worth it. It's a pity because I used to think that this is the best restaurant in Belgrade."
Madera,Beograd,4.3,"Rude guest not respecting old people with disability, using offensive language and ageism. The staff was not helpful. They all seemed self-absorbed. I will not be returning to that place again."

Madera,Beograd,4.3,"A perfect place for a romantic dinner. Chic place, cozy atmosphere, staff attentive to your needs.
We followed the recommendations for the choice of starters, they were excellent and local. The dishes and wines were also of high quality. A local digestive was offered to us (Bermet).
We recommend this place."
Madera,Beograd,4.3,"uring my visit to Belgrade, I had the pleasure of dining at Madera, one of the city’s most renowned restaurants. Located in the heart of the capital, near Tašmajdan Park, Madera offers a perfect blend of elegance, history, and exceptional cuisine."
Madera,Beograd,4.3,"Idyll in the truest sense of the word – a place that embodies everything the term can symbolize. Perfect for true gourmets and hedonists who know how to enjoy food at the highest level. There were six of us, and each person had their own personal waiter who carefully served the food. At places like this, price is not the question – you’re there to surrender to the flavors and enjoy good company. In the end, everyone carefully helped us put on our coats, and as a finishing touch, we were greeted with a mint candy at the exit, which has a soothing effect on the stomach and can help alleviate bloating after a hearty meal."
Madera,Beograd,4.3,"Very beautiful place. Pleasant and polite staff. 
In my opinion the ratio of price and quality would be better but what we ate was ok."
Madera,Beograd,4.3,The service was very polite and quick. The food was delicious too. The ambience is convenient for dining in style. Reservations may be required.

Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,May not be proper for business dinner if it starts later in the evening. too little food
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"Hello, is the price written next to the 7-course menu in your current menu the Serbian dinar price?"
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,The environment is beautiful but is definitely not value for money place. I asked for the vegetarian 5 meal course and I was very disappointed. Out of the 5 plates in noted only the two.
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,A restaurant where every moment feels like a feast — absolutely the best in its field!
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"I got proposed to here! Everything was unbelievably beautiful, thank you so, so much. The ambiance and the food were amazing! The staff's hospitality and warmth were beyond perfect! They had even closed the restaurant just for us. We had a tasting experience in our own language with the help of AI to better understand the dishes, which was such a thoughtful touch. On top of that, the 'traditional bread' story they came up with for the proposal made it truly unforgettable. It was the most romantic moment of our engagement. Thank you especially for that, too. From A to Z, we experienced top quality and incredible flavors. And a special thank you to the gentleman who personally took care of us. With love :)"
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"Such sn amazing experience- elegant setting in a stunning building with beautiful background music playing. Service was outstanding- all the waiting staff highly professional & special praise for tye somelier too who was spot on with his recommendations 

The tasting menu was high quality. Interesting dishes that were a creative spark to traditional serbian cuisine - all really tasty & enjoyable.

Its expensive. But its not just a dinner, its an evening experience much like going to the theatre. Highly recommend this & it is worth paying the money for. Enjoy"
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"My experience at Salon 1905 in Belgrade was disappointing. The service was slow, and the staff seemed unprofessional. The atmosphere didn’t live up to expectations, and overall, it was not worth the visit. I wouldn’t recommend it. 1 star."
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"This is a unique place, and that is something we must always take into account. Since that way we can better understand the experience itself. What is the uniqueness of this place?, is to try to sell an elegance and exclusive treatment and from another period, although I do not think it will succeed. 

We will find different closed menu options, in our case it was a seven course menu with wine for 210€ per head. In the reservation you are told a small ""dress code"" that later seen is not fulfilled, and this would be the first hit, if you ask something enforce it, if not directly obvious the request. 

The salon is simply spectacular, the service very correct perhaps for my taste somewhat invasive, and within it The sommelier is perhaps his loosest point in this field, not so much for his knowledge, which I am sure are ample if not for the forms, slightly patronizing. 

The food being so wide menu becomes paused and elongated , without saturating the elaborations are well executed , with some that stand out over the others. But you will not find anything memorable, or that will make you come back when you return to Belgrade, once lived the experience has no hook to return to it. 

Whether you are thinking about coming or not, I recommend going is going to be a unique experience at a high but affordable cost. But I'm telling you there's nothing beyond that to make you come back or remember the visit. 

It takes the four stars although perhaps it is closer to three...."
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"Fantastic feeling, we felt very special. Our children got an additional dessert with ""children-friendly"" mochito from the main chef. The stuff was very pleasant and well educated about all meals and wines. We got cards about every dish that we got served. The enviroment was beutiful and inspiring as well, but the best was the main chef's creativity. The food was delicious!"
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"Very weird experience. Business dinner with customer, 6 people, we chose a course of 5 dishes + wine paring. Started at 6pm after intense working day and no food. Even with a compliment from the house - a tiny kebab, we stayed hungry. Portions over tiny, mixed tastes and colours and unclear choice of sequence. At the same time, too much cheap local wine (Aleksandrovic, Radovanovic, Kisch - easy find at any supermarket) - mixed sparkling, white and red and Bermet at the end. Bottom line - yes, fine dining, but they overdid it, too little food vs too much suspicious wine = stomach problems for most guests and terrible headache for alcohol. The bill was over 1000 EUR. We ended up at a hotel restaurant to fill ourselves in. 
One more thing - the place is tiny in fact, if most tables are occupied with guests, it is hard to imagine what it would feel like in terms of talking, and listening to each other."
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"Spectacular ambience, well-trained and attentive staff, interesting and artsy culinary, fine dining experience at a most reasonable price (compared to other establishments in Europe and the US). If there’s something to point out would be the attire of the sommelier (I believe it would be best to put on a more appropriate suit so as to be in harmony with the general atmosphere of the surroundings)."
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"We had the 5 course menu:
- portions too small, we were still hungry after the 5 courses
- Almost nothing crunchy or hot, in all the dishes we find emulsions and espuma..
- 70 euros more for the food and wine assortment, the sommelier does not provide any explanation on the wines. Besides, the glasses are only half full, even though we pay full price
- The waiters speak quickly like robots, we don't understand the explanations

Way too expensive, tasteless, portions too small"
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"My partner and I are living on a vegan diet but didn't wan't to miss the opportunity to dine at this beautiful location. 
Within minutes after sending the restaurant a request per mail, I received a reply that they are happy to create a vegan menu for us!

The location was beautiful and the service outstanding! There was a 3 man live band playing great jazz and setting the right vibe.
We got offered a 3 or a 5 course vegan menu.
After a beautiful dinner the chef came to check on us and we had a nice little chat about his teams effort to create a outstanding vegan menu.

This was the best part of out weekend visit of Belgrade! Highly recommended!"
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"We visited this restaurant with a couple of friends and we are all fully satisfied. The place is very nice and elegant, the food is fantastic and the staff are deeply professional. Our seven course menu lasted for three hours and all dishes were carefully presented also on a card which accompanied each course. It is definitely worth the visit. We all had a really good experience here."
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"A very beautiful building with a spectacular staircase that takes you into an impressive room, a little baroque but quite majestic
The dishes are delicate and good. Excellent carpaccio, fantastic parmesan risotto and very good veal fillet. Some Serbian wines are up to standard, notably whites and roses
Small downside with a rigid waiter who thinks he is a schoolmaster and takes the guests for kids."
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"Overall very dissapointing. 

Firstly inside felt cold and the atmosphere was more like a funeral rather than a restaurant. The energy from front of house was pretentious.

The food was abysmal as well as the presentation. Meat overcooked and everything tasted bland."
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"Dear Mark,

Thank you for your review and the effort you put into pointing out our possible shortcomings to us. However, I must say that your assessments are either vague or uncertain.

Regarding the building exterior you mentioned, it is almost 120 years old, dating back to a time when the edifice had a profoundly different purpose. Since then, it has become a significant cultural monument, well before we established our business inside it. In other words, we had nothing to do with its design or historical significance.

As for the atmosphere, our guests usually find it relaxing and welcoming. Perhaps you are simply not accustomed to a more solemn and toned-down mood, similar to that of a funeral.

When you complain about the food, we would greatly appreciate it if you could provide more details about the issue. Knowing which dish or course you had a problem with would enable us to pay closer attention and avoid similar mistakes in the future.

With all due respect, your review, regarding both the food and the atmosphere, comes across as generic, hasty, and arbitrary. If you could be more specific with your feedback, we might all find more value in it.

Kind regards,

Salon 1905"
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"My first real gourmet experience in Serbia. Top location, stylishly furnished, attentive staff, wine accompaniment perfectly matched to the food. You have to try it at least once."
Salon 1905,Beograd,4.5,"I should not have given this restaurant another chance. 

After my first disappointment in 2021 I decided to give 1905 another chance. Any restaurant can have a bad day, and I normally trust Michelin rating/mentions. This years visit started like last visit, the beautiful restaurant is inviting and creates expectations. But like last year the positive experience stopped there. Regular service that you don’t expect on a restaurant at this price range in combination with pretentiously presented but badly executed food. This restaurant is for show off but not for foodies/gourmands. Belgrade has many good restaurants - but this one isn’t."

Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,"We had a wonderful experience. Both the staff and the regular customers truly embraced us in every sense of the word as soon as they found out that we are Greek.
The food was excellent, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the place itself is a remarkable historical venue. An unforgettable experience that reflects genuine hospitality."
Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,"It is amazing!!! The place you have to go if you visit Beograd. Excellent food ,service, atmosphere. Πραγματικά υπέροχες σερβικής γευσεις. Θα ξανάρθουμε!!!"
Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,"Been there many times, all because good experience first couple of times. Now, every time I go, food and service are getting worse. Chewy meat, slow servers, completely not interested in customers. On my latest visit, drunk local guy was harassing Russian couple, sat at their table, servers did nothing. No sense of care for people visiting restaurant who is giving them paychecks. shame."
Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,"Love this place, the service and food are amazing. Always kind, professional with affordable prices. Must visit in Belgrade."
Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,"Cozy, Soviet style interior, good food, very reasonable prices. If you like it - this is your place; if you like something more luxury & snobbish - could be disappointed. Best of all - music after 9 pm; very nice, native, professional. Amazing how those musician playing in so crowd place. Enjoy!"
Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,"a small restaurant, rather basic amenities and local Serbian cuisine. Prices are reasonable, atmosphere as far as okay . In the backyard, not quite easy to find. from 9:15 pm there was, good, live music (2 guitarists). Recommended, but not really outstanding"
Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,Thanks for the free apple! I like everything you do! Such a good soup you have! I hope we will be back soon! Hello for all from Korcagin! Kosovo is Serbia ❤️
Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,"The meals were so excellent that we went back a second time 
Very professional servers 
To welcome you he offers you a slivovitz"
Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,"Special food. Prices are excellent. Environment patriot and nostalgic living in the era of socialism of Yugoslavia. I saw it on the trip advisor and I came and it was the best option. Although I'm a strong food player, I can eat and the tables here I kneel. You're not going to eat tourist food here, but like a real Serbian. And only when I saw the Greek flag next to the Serbian on the ceiling I felt a fear and a pride penetrating me. Worth 5*****."
Kafana Pavle Korcagin,Beograd,4.8,"I WAS THERE ON A VERY FALLEN JULY EVENING, CONVINCED BY THE GOOD REVIEWS I FOUND HERE, BUT ALAS I CAN'T REALLY SHARE THEM
AVERAGE FOOD, THEY MADE US SIT IN A ROOM HALFWAY BETWEEN INDOORS AND OUTDOORS WHERE I THINK IT WAS OVER 30 DEGREES WITHOUT TELLING US THEY HAD A LOT OF FREE TABLES OUTSIDE, THEY WERE PROBABLY UNCOMFORTABLE SERVICE
FOOD , I REPEAT, NOTHING PARTICULAR, AND THE MOST SERIOUS THING AT THE TIME OF THE ACCOUNT, THEY ASKED US HOW WE INTENDED TO PAY AND WHEN I SAID BY CARD, FIRST THEY PRETENDED THERE WAS NO LINE, IN THE END THEY ACCEPTED BY ADDING A SURCHARGE OF ABOUT 10 % ON THE ACCOUNT , INVENTING A STATE TAX, WHICH NOBODY ELSE HAS EVER ASKED US.
SHAME ON YOU|!"

Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"Digital Payments, Accepts credit cards: American Express, Mastercard, Visa"
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,Be prepared for some service disappointments so that they do not spoil the enjoyment of food
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"If you’re in Belgrade and craving a polished fine‑dining experience with a quietly confident kitchen, Langouste’s 8‑course tasting menu delivers a thoughtful arc of flavors, precise technique, and genuinely warm service. Expect elegant plating, clean flavors, and a few playful nods to regional ingredients—capped by a standout roasted duck and a whimsical “Save the Bees” dessert. My favorite foie gras course was silky, cool, and impeccably seasoned—paired with toasted brioche and a gently sweet fruit element (think quince or fig). The balance between richness, sweetness, and a touch of acidity is spot‑on. 
My second best was roasted duck which was 24 hours cooked - if i remeber well. The skin is glass‑crisp with a lacquered sheen; the meat remains undeniably rosy and tender. Accents lean savory‑fruity."
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"Wonderful dinner, the tasting menu shows the whole palette of the chef’s art, in the dishes we find a subtle mix of European and Serbian cuisine with a Japanese touch. The Serbian wines offered with the food and wine pairing are a great discovery, especially the whites and this muscat rosé for dessert.  A thank you to our waiter who was able to bring the extra touch to enhance this meal."
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,A beautiful setting with food that I ran out of superlatives to describe half way through. My amazing waiter made the experience even more unforgettable. Cannot recommend highly enough. Highest praises to everyone involved. Just stunning
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"It is amazing that Belgrade and Serbia now have their first star restaurant. But it actually holds a goal. Had an eight-day menu that was simply hard to remember when one had eaten it. Most of it was good but not more than that, it lacked the Wow factor simply. The meal composite was in quantity large enough for most. There was emphasis on some local raw materials and that was good. But one can question the fact that serving a 15 days old diadem is sustainable. The locks are fine, the service pleasant and attentive. But price and quality are in my head not star quality. Compared to restuaranties with one star in Norway, a country with much higher costs than in Serbia, the price level is not very different. It may differ 30-40 euros on a menu. The number of bits, servings in Norway is also much higher and the quality and creativity correspond. For its own sake it was worth the money and the visit alone to be at the first star restaurant in Serbia. But the experience was well like buying and trying one of the world’s most expensive cheeses made of donkey milk and produced in Serbia. So the recommendation must be that you rather go to one of the many other excellent restaurants in Belgrade where you get more value for money. That being said, I wish Langouste luck with the further development of the restaurant and hope there will be more restaurants in Belgrade coming after. One must be the first and it was Langouste who won that award."
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"We had the chance to dine in this restaurant a few weeks after getting their 1st*Michelin. We were a great table of 6 people and we all dined ""à la carte"". Meals excellent classic cuisine but extremely well executed. Perfect service and excellent wine list. The star is well deserved and the team will not stop there. The only cultural remark the room is smoking and I must say that it is very embarrassing for a meal of such quality."
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"It gives me no pleasure to rate it just 2 stars, because the food is actually quite good, but certain faux pas are just inexcusable for even a regular upscale restaurant, let alone a Michelin-starred one. I hope the mgmt. corrects these mistakes. First, they do not have any bubbly by the glass and push customers towards a demi-bottle for $55. They do have kir royale on the menu, but we were informed that ""it was not available"", and neither was any cocktail with champagne, prosecco, or any other bubbly! It was only after my strenuous objection and plain explanation that they could simply open a bottle and make the drink that they relented. The second foul was the fact that they only allow prix fixe (fine), the cheapest is just over 100eur (fine), but the bill added measly 500din (<$5) cover charge pp! How ridiculous! Guys, this is for cheap restaurants, so that people do not order a plate of french fries and sit there for 2 hrs, not when you already get 25x that much! If you must, charge 500din more for the prix fixe! Finally, they do not allow BYOB even with a corkage fee, which I also find in bad taste. The explanation was even worse: ""the previous chef was entertaining his buddies and they would bring tons of wine and drink for free, hence the new policy..."" Guys, charge even 50-100eur corkage fee, one bottle max pp, no wines from your own list, but allow customers who might celebrate a special moment to bring their special bottle that they have been saving for years for such an occasion!"
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"Great view overlooking the Sava River. Definitely a special occasion place, with visitors dressed up and probably on dates. Michelin recommended (not starred). Fish and seafood focused. Option for tasting menu or a la carte. Expensive for Serbia but a good deal relative to comparable places elsewhere in Europe. They allow indoor smoking, but have a designated nonsmoking section and thankfully, no one was smoking the night we went."
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"Impeccable service, but on other hand rather empty. Perfect for formal meetings. Was seated near window so had opportunity to enjoy the perfect view of Danub and Sava river"
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"We ate 2 times in Langouste during our week-long stay in Belgrade. At first, we came just with my wife and we ordered lobster menu. The lobster was prepared in 2 ways: with pasta and grilled with a bit of sauce and vegetables and we really enjoyed it. Introduction to the meal were 3 small and very interesting appetizers. Combined with uninterrupted views of Sava River, it was absolutely 5-stars, if I was making a review just based on the visit. But in 2 days we came back being 4 people already. We chose fish menu (which to my uneducated eye should be easier to perfect compared to lobster one), the restaurant agreed to adapt it a bit to our tastes and food preferences (my wife doesn’t eat dishes from raw fish) and we definitely appreciated the flexibility. But for the main course we got John Dory – tasteless, hard and a bit over-burned. Again, to be fair, the restaurant charged us for 2 John Dory only – this is again appreciated, but I would have preferred to pay for all 4 dishes subject to everyone enjoying them. All in all, not a bad place, if you are up to Michelin restaurant style and prices. But afterwards we found a much better fish restaurant in Belgrade."
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"As a passionate visitor to the beautiful city of Belgrade, I have had Langouste on my ""to go"" list for a long time.

Now I have finally found my way there. Beautiful location with a wonderful view of the Sava River. The atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, but still has some potential. Sometimes it gives a somewhat sterile or empty impression.

I received four different amuse bouches, from a cornet with shiitake mushrooms to a puff pastry filled with Serbian cream cheese to a mushroom ragout to a brioche with truffle butter. The best brioche I have ever eaten. Excellent. And I was almost no longer hungry afterwards. :-)

For the starter there was fish carpaccio with thinly sliced beetroot, chestnuts, horseradish foam and an orange sauce. Very tasty and recommended.

For the main course I chose the beef fillet, which was also good. I have very high standards when it comes to meat, so unfortunately it doesn't come close to an excellent rating. The sauce and especially the side dish, a kind of creamy wheat peppered with fried duck liver, were top class.

All in all, a very tasty dinner with a wonderful view and excellent and friendly service."
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"Fantastic restaurant! A unique experience if you like culinary indulgence. A three-star chef originally from Paris, who came to Belgrade. Beautiful decor, wonderful views over the Danube and delicious, refined, tasty dishes matched with sublime matched local wines."
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"Our first time in Belgrade with my friend and we were recommended to visit Langouste restaurant, I have to say this place deserves all Michelin stars and our server name was Marco, he went above and beyond to make our first dinner in Belgrade so memorable! We were given the best table with a view and Marco surprised us with a few complimentary dishes and an amazing desert! Atmosphere is very private and super attentive staff. Marco made sure we had the best time and explained every dish so well, one of the most tasteful dishes we had was Rooster cooked in red wine sauce, fish carpaccio and lemon tart desert all recommended by Marco. Thanks for such an amazing evening we will remember this place and come back on our next visit to Belgrade."
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,Best restaurant we have been to in Serbia. Quality tasting menu with wine flight. Waiter provided excellent service and was culturally interesting to talk to. Based on UK prices fantastic value as well.
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,Top view and good service. The food preparation was great but the taste for a star restaurant was not meeting our expectations.
Langouste Restaurant,Beograd,4.6,"Excellent experience in Langouste Restaurant. High level in the cuisine was matched by excellent service. The selection of local products, the innovative cuisine and the and the relaxed atmosphere contributed to a memorable and enjoyable lunch. I inhibited a chef who works in a one star Michelin in France and he was impressed. Congrats to the team and to the Chef."

Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,"Try a small shop, the ice cream is fabulous, the chicken chocolate ice cream, and the rum and grape is a varied and very successful option I don’t see anywhere else. Must try"
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,"It was a recommendation from our friend. You can choose the ice cream by tasting, already the employees recommend a ice cream mix, the shop is small but cute, and there are bedding to sit in front and inside. It was crowded because it’s a famous spot, but we didn’t wait too long, and when you come to Belgrade, you’ve definitely got to stop by."
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,Too expensive. Ice cream is too sweet and you get too small cons. It is not worghty. Try anywhere else. Luff or some other. Really to expensive.
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,"All I drank here was a cappuccino, sugar-free. It tasted like a disgusting bitter, fishy-tasting swill. Before I finished, my hands were swollen, my palms were itching, although there were no allergies and my stomach had been sore for two weeks."
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,Lots of different ice cream flavours. Very yummy. Service is good. I definitely recommend a visit if you like ice cream.
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,Probably the best ice cream i ever had. So smooth and creamy with excellent flavours. We visited every day of our holiday
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,"Obviously overpriced. Nothing special here. Not even similar to the real Italian icecream, even to the cheap one. False positive."
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,"I used to get ice cream here all the time and it's great with different flavours and creative combos, but unfortunately only tourists can afford it now."
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,"The ice cream was good but much worse than anywhere else in Italy. I paid 1850 dinars (€18) for three ice creams, two scoops each, without sitting in the bar, the price is as if I was in Monte Carlo or Sardinia. It's a shame how much it costs"
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,"We ate 2 scoops of ice cream and paid 520 dinars in total. The ice creams are both large portions and very delicious, making it a popular tourist spot.

Definitely a place to try"
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,We sought it out on our first night in town and went back the next day because the taste was unique and we couldn't leave without trying it again!
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,"The flavor of the ice cream was very intense and delicious. They sell ice cream by the gram, and there is a separate charge per cone. I definitely say experience."
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,Very good ICE CREAM. There are diffrent kind and mix of tast. They offer you to try it for free. Price is little higger but for this quality totaly OK
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,"This ice cream is very fancy, pricier but quality ingredients and many options to choose from ,the flavour i had the taste was good"
Crna Ovca,Beograd,4.7,Crna Ovca has amazing ice creams! The line was long because the ice creams are so good. Absolutely will be back for another one!

The only one is the equipment without tablecloth or Americans with the obligation to place the cutlery on the table.
If you love paella this is the best."
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"Great restaurant, maybe a bit overrated here on Tripadvisor. Paella ok, good wines. Serving straightforward, but maybe somewhat eccentric. For hot red wine, it became better after a walk in the refrigerator at the table."
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"Was a real disappointment.
We had booked to celebrate a birthday, but they didn't find it again. 
The food was disappointing, but the service even more so. Unfriendly almost laughing at us. 
While we were still having aperitifs, the main switch came from my wife and I had to wait. 
We were told to leave within the hour and the window was opened at 4 degrees Celsius....
We will never come back here"
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"Very good paella,
Good portion per person
Excellent treatment from reception, very nice place to live"
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"Good and quick service. The space is huge, they have 3 or 4 stands outside. When it comes to the food; the price is a little expensive but nothing outrageous, the paella was really good, rice and shrimp cooked to perfection. The ONLY thing I disliked and the reason why I’m not giving a higher rating is the calamari that was rubbery and had a weird taste."
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"Overpriced, not worth it. Found a hair in the paella, dirty, eaten in the outdoors in the cold, sent away for shift change. NOT COUNCIL"
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,We had been in the Latina location where the ambient was much better and the staff was behaving more professionally: the dining area was busy with kitchen and serving staff moving around food and utensils. Traffic was unbearable . Food quality was below expectation too. Even the paella.
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"All very good: location, food and service. As to atmosphere surrounding tables were somewhat loud affecting our enjoyment of the occasion."
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"Went on the reviews here and not disappointed. Really busy restaurant.
 We had Delicious mixed paella
Value for money 
Good service"
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"Mixed experience. Rice main dish was great....but starters were not good, tomato salad with non-fresh tomatoes, but the most annoying part was that the waiter didn't know anything about the menu....I wasn't expecting for a recommendation, but at least the basic ability to explain the difference between some dishes, something that he couldn't do. We didn't like the approach, the fact that food was rushed, that once we finish eating we were pushed either to order a dessert or leave (even though we still had more than 40 mins on the time allocated to the table as per booking conditions). We decided that we didn't want to stay longer and left to have a dessert and coffee somewhere else.

Great food it's the basic of a restaurant, but if staff is not polite, well prepared and without the basic manners, there is no way that I will go back......"
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"Out of the crowd and tourist crowd, quiet place, I recommend booking, we were on the evening of December 7 with Madrid overflowing with tourists, but here you have to get there by metro , small but very cozy place, you eat very well , high quality , friendly and fast staff . Exceptional paella ...... highly recommended"
Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"The service, the food, the paella, the cheese cake everything was perfect I recommend, it is a wonder."

Taberna de Peñalver,Madrid,4.7,"Broad, tree-lined avenues with pretty streetlights frame the neighborhood of Barrio Salamanca. With beautiful condominium buildings that make up most blocks in this area, this part of town is refined and quiet. It is also host to a few of the city's large shopping avenues, including Calle Serrano and Calle Jose Ortega y Gasset. A walk down these streets will reveal upscale chains, small boutiques, and plenty of opportunities for shopping or checking out the stylish displays. The locals here are polished and fashionable, the atmosphere is leisurely, and the lush Retiro Park on the southern border is yet another opportunity to enjoy the outdoors. A stroll through Barrio Salamanca is all about admiring the beautiful architecture, window-shopping, and people-watching in this upper-crust corner of Madrid."

El Pampeano Asador Argentino,Madrid,4.9,"Excellent food, deal too. Reasonable prices.
The only one but the place is noisy. There seems to be nothing to absorb the noise from the tables, there were few tables occupied in the premises and yet it was difficult to have a conversation.
Despite this, it is worth it."
El Pampeano Asador Argentino,Madrid,4.9,"We ate mullet, provolet, empty, Neapolitan Milanese, white chocolate alfajor and Argentine flan
All riquiiiisiiimooo!!
The waitress, Irene, very nice, has also recommended and explained very well each cut of meat!
Pleasure!"

Taberna El Sur,Madrid,4.7,Enjoyed the tortilla de pata and seafood paella! Lovely service and super friendly. Definitely recommend adding this to the list of places you visit in Madrid!
Taberna El Sur,Madrid,4.7,"Excellent food! Restaurant quality . Friendly bar with great staff who poured me “mega pint “ of wine! How can u tell this is great place ? They got couple groups of Asians here. But mostly locals. While we r here for the hour, people come in and out . Families, couples , And then this group of 16 showed up. Busy and good ! Ask for Senor Guapo! He will give you a mega pint pour 🤣🤣"
Taberna El Sur,Madrid,4.7,"The 3rd day of the trip to Spain, I think I visited the most friendly and fun restaurant.
Thanks to visiting with family, we had a variety of menus, and all were delicious. I asked to make it less spicy, so the food wasn't too spicy.
(Garibey, Faye, Basil, Jambas, Piedmont-de-Fatiron, etc.)
It was a satisfying meal enough to have added 3 times of bread.
It was even more satisfying to eat a delicious cheesecake especially after a meal👍🏻👍🏻"

Taberna El Sur,Madrid,4.7,"Expansive plazas, local and foreign crowds, street performers, colorful lights, window shopping, restaurant signs promising the best paella, ham, and churros con chocolate- this is downtown Madrid, a collection of plazas interconnected by a network of side streets. Some of these side streets are wide pedestrian shopping routes, and some are hidden, so it's possible to duck in and out of the bustle as desired. The iconic Puerta del Sol is the giant crossroads of the city and a must-see attraction at any time of the day. The nearby Plaza Mayor, completely enclosed by historic red buildings, is an ideal place to grab a bite to eat outside, amidst scores of tables and people out for a stroll. Plaza Isabel II (also known as “Opera”) is smaller and a good meeting spot, and the stately Plaza del Oriente is the front yard of the Royal Palace. Centro can be touristy (pickpockets are unfortuately not unheard-of here), crowded, and sometimes gimmicky, but it is also the place to experience classic Madrid."

Highly recommended in the area of Cava Baja , Barrio La Latina Madrid."
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"Great, we have eaten fabulous grilled octopus the veiras and that sea bass and for those who like Austrian holiday loin meat, dessert Great and the attention of the waiters very well, especially Macarena Great, their attention Great"
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"There's not too much to write about: one of the best paellas ever eaten! We are passing through Madrid and near our accommodation we found this restaurant, a wonderful discovery, we waited for the paella with ham and bread very good... Highly recommended"
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"We chose to eat lobster rice and a helping of chistorra to start with.
It was good, the food was good, the service was good, reasonable price"
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"Unfortunately, my experience at this restaurant was disappointing. While the food itself was acceptable, the service was poorly organized.

Our dishes arrived separately, and the timing made no sense—my main course was served before the starter, which arrived much later. This completely disrupted the meal and took away from the dining experience.

Dining out should feel relaxed and enjoyable, not confusing and rushed. For the prices charged, I expected much better coordination from the kitchen and service staff.

Sadly, I wouldn’t recommend this place based on this experience."
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"We stayed here for dinner by reservation, really nice restaurant and in a nice and quiet area. 
We had a really good and plentiful mixed paella, although the pieces of meat had lost a bit of flavor apart from that nothing to say, the price was right.
Croquettes (given the long wait for paella that we had been warned about) and really good vegetables but with an exaggerated price, 16 € for 4 croquettes is excessive, they cost twice as much as the average of restaurants of their same level, the same goes for grilled vegetables that cost 16 €.
The staff was really friendly and helpful and also the service is very well taken care of, it deserves 5 out of 5 but for fairness I put 4 for the quality / price ratio that should be improved on certain courses, since competitors are there and have much fairer prices on certain dishes, the exception is the paella which had a more than reasonable price."
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"We ordered the paella, but did not realize you have to order for 2 person. The waiter did not say anything to us, but instead tried to upsell more food. When we realized the paella was for 2 person, a couple minutes later, we tried to change the order, but the waiter would not let us change the order. The paella came and it was terrible.. the taste was blah and the seafood was stale and not fresh. The octopus was good though."
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"We found this restaurant through TripAdvisor.
The restaurant's standards were not met at all.
Upon entering, the music was very loud, and the staff did not appear very cheerful.
The service was provided by only young individuals, and while there is no issue with that, it seemed there was no experienced figure to organize the service.
In my opinion, the food was very average.
I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone.
Even the interior decoration appeared poorly maintained.
I suggest considering other options as you can find much better in Madrid.
This establishment is completely overrated."
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"The place isn't worth its money, paelle regular, the price is on the menu for 1, but you can't order a portion like that, for at least two. 55€ is expensive for a dish like this. No sangria, don't order unless you want to be disappointed. They barely understand English. Anyway, no more than yes."
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"Delicious paella. And sweet, attentive service from a lady (Yadira).
It is located in a cozy neighborhood, just outside the worst crowds. Beautiful decor vh restaurant - white linen and warm colors vh interior."
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"Small room with outdoor veranda , very kind and professional the Honduran girl who serves our table.
A thousand and one nights fish paella"
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"A spectacular experience, all very delicious, in case you have a cut with the bottle of water helen cures you, very good home remedies"
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"My wife and I were in Madrid and visited this restaurant. We received excellent service from Carlos, a very friendly young man who knew very well the dishes, and wines they offer. The starter was a dish called blizzard peppers, exquisite. Then a Paella Señorat, very rich and abundant. The atmosphere, from a prime restaurant. Anyway, I can say it was the best dinner of our trip."
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"Very nice place in the Latina district, excellent food and above all very good paella. They have about fifteen different types, we chose the seafood one, tasty and abundant, one of the best ever tasted.
The potato tortilla is also good, perhaps a little too drooling for our taste.
Fair wine list, good prices.
We spent about 55€ per person, correct price."
La Taberna De Peñalver Cava Baja,Madrid,4.7,"Nice place. Fast service. The only drawback they push to make you take more courses and not just paella saying it takes a long time. 
We had a tortilla that was good but in the end it overfilled us and we left a bit of both. 
If you are not a big eater I recommend ordering only paella."

La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"Plaza de las Cortes, 7 The Palace, A Luxury Collection Hotel, Madrid, 28014 Madrid Spain"
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"The lovely place, but the service improveable, the service is sometimes slow is why 4 stars, everything else great"
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"The elaborate La Rotonda is under reconstruction. The restaurant is operating in a very fine setting in the room next door. The menu is unchanged from the grand facility. The service and food were excellent. The wine list did not show the vintage of the bottles offered. This shows the establishment is not serious about wine as did the small number of selections offered. With this caveat, dinner was fine in all respects."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"The Palace Hotel has a filter: Miss Giulia.

We ordered two glasses of the budget champagne. She served us, with that superior smile, the most expensive glasses on the menu.

Your message, clear and loud: ""They either have status, or they don't come back here.""

It was not a mistake, it was a class certification of economic status. Excellent Service for those seeking exclusivity by exclusion.

Giulia and Palace: A deal as high as its price."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"Gracias por compartir su experiencia con nosotros. Lamentamos sinceramente la percepción que se llevó durante su visita. En The Palace Hotel, Madrid, el trato respetuoso y equitativo hacia todos nuestros huéspedes es un principio fundamental, por lo que queremos asegurarle que no existe ningún tipo de filtro, preferencia o conducta basada en estatus económico.

En relación con el servicio ofrecido, revisaremos lo ocurrido con Giulia para comprender mejor la situación y evitar cualquier confusión con las recomendaciones o sugerencias de productos. Nuestro objetivo es siempre ofrecer opciones de manera transparente, nunca imponer elecciones ni transmitir incomodidad.

Agradecemos que nos haya señalado este punto, pues nos ayuda a seguir mejorando. Nos gustaría tener la oportunidad de recibirle nuevamente y brindarle una experiencia acorde con los estándares de hospitalidad que representamos."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"In the dome of the palace, excellent place, spacious and comfortable, menu ""the dome"" at 42 euros, to choose 3 first, second and pole , with a drink included."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"Awful experience, Voluntary but ruthless Service, and an unacceptable dish that did not respond at all to what I had ordered and that smelled frighteningly rotten, as the waiters themselves recognized and that you asked to remove before returning at the same table for the stench it gave off. Expensive and worse than bad. Very sad in what has become the old and wonderful Palace roundabout. If you met her, don't come back, if you don't already know her, dispense with being crunched and given suspicious food."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"We went to enjoy brunch and the experience far exceeded our expectations. From the start, the treatment was impeccable, with attentive and professional Service in a serene and elegantly designed environment. The musical accompaniment, with piano and opera duet, was simply masterful.

It is clear that, after the recent renovation, the hotel is committed to excellence and works hard to achieve the level of the best luxury establishments in the city.

Special mention is made of Pedro Fonseca, head of the Food and Beverage department, for his impeccable management, and Gustavo García, the hotel’s sommelier, for his kindness and deep knowledge. An outstanding experience that we will certainly repeat."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"This appears to be a lovely and an attractive dining option if you are a local. Although we ordered a full meal with an expensive bottle of wine, we waited endlessly for service and continued to have to ask for wine pours and additional needs. All the while, the servers provided excellent service enjoyed lengthy conversations with the obviously local residents. We understand that they realize we are unlikely to return, but this is not treatment you expect for an upscale restaurant. The food is above average but not exceptional. Sides and salad were good. Fish was undercooked, with one portion being nearly raw. Sorry to give a poor review for any restaurant in a city we love. We may go back for drinks in the lovely bar someday, but not to dine."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,Good afternoon..actually if we ate at their restaurant but the staff did not check if we had or not reservation..it was a bittersweet experience because I made the reservation with a lot of enthusiasm and high expectations and it was an absolute disappointment..the staff was polite but they absolutely passed us..we had to call them for everything and considering the prices they have I think the attention should be more careful. We thought that in a restaurant of this category at least they should put a tablecloth .. it did not look like a restaurant but a cafeteria .. I thought that was not the case but I saw that I was wrong although the price of the drink is of michelin star. I can't say anything outstanding about the food either because it was rather mediocre for what they charge..on one of the plates they put a bowl of undressed lettuce and didn't even ask if I wanted to do it...anyway a nonsense for what we pay
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,Madrid cuisine reinvented in a historic space of exceptional elegance and flavor. Flavors of Madrid with a modern twist under an iconic dome
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"Disappointing, absolutely disappointing. Waiters waste your time waiting until they attend to you without knowing that ""time is gold"", especially in a place like this. I do not recommend it, unless you want to waste the afternoon.🇪🇸"
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"NEFARIOUS experience.
We had a Reservation for 3 months in the restaurant LA ROTONDA of the WESTIN PALACE hotel with the offer of 30% ""THE FORK"" and the truth that our experience could not be worse...

As soon as we arrive, we say that we have a Reservation in the ROUNDABOUT to celebrate our anniversary (I indicated this at the time of Reservation) and we are passed to a dining room unworthy of a 5-star hotel like the WESTIN PALACE. We say that this is not the place where we have booked and we are told that they are in the works and that the restaurant is closed that now the dinners are there... we started badly but decided to stay to eat (we were surprised that it had only occupied a table of 5 people...)

We ordered wine, foie and steak tartare. They bring us the foie and it was a dish of very poor quality. The hard foie, very hard (you can tell they just took it out of the cold room because there were parts that were freezing). We talk to the waiter who tells us that he has ""transmitted it to the kitchen so that the next time he gets heat stroke and the frozen dish does not come out"". I don't know if by the dates they are and the works if the head chef was on vacation because you can't bring out a dish like that. You had to eat the foie in tacos as it was impossible to spread it over the muffins. The steak tartare very good and so we told the waiter.

The food was being cold, the dining room thawed, ugly and empty and regular food so we decided to pay and leave as it was not at all what we expected.

They bring us the account and we see that they have not applied the discount of 30% with which we made the Reservation and the waiter replies that ""for some time they have not worked with the fork"" to which I indicate that I have the Reservation so made, that I have 3 emails remembering said Reservation to confirm it and that at no time I have other information. At that moment the one who seems to be in charge arrives and tells us that it must be a problem of ""THE FORK"", that they now work with ""SEVEN ROOMS"" and that they cannot apply me the offer with which I booked, that I have to pay the full bill and that I claim to the fork, which is not their problem, that they thought that there were no outstanding reservations with this platform. 

Seriously, can a room manager give this answer to clients? At that time we asked for the claim sheet and that we do not agree at all with this, that the problem is yours for not having cancelled reservations. For more indignation I get into the application of the fork and check that the offer is still valid and that it can be reserved for the month of September and October with -30% which makes everything more subreal. 

After 5 minutes he brings the claim sheet and tells me to show him the Reservation Mail (it seems that he doesn't believe us...) and tells me again that he can't apply the offer and that he doesn't know what to do to discount that 30% to which my wife tells him to ""take a plate and it's done even if it's less than that 30% and we get hurt"" and to her it seems a magnificent solution for what we paid and we left with very bad taste in our mouths and with the certainty that we won't go again. 

If you presume to be a 5-star restaurant you have to prove it both in the food, in the place and in the service and this time none of this was so and showed us that they are not able to give solutions to the problems that have arisen. 

If you have the restaurant closed and you are going to relocate the diners in ""a room"" you must inform them (for that they have the customers' mail and phone), the food must leave in kitchen conditions (from a plate of 30 € is the minimum expected) and if you have reservations with conditions that you have not canceled you must meet them."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"Very good if not excellent service, old school, good food with classic dishes but also more modern dishes (e.g. the wellness menu), good selection of wines although not very extensive, fascinating surroundings as always, calm atmosphere and for what they offer, a good value for money."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"We stayed a week at this hotel and ate here everyday for breakfast. The restaurant itself is gorgeous! The stained glass ceiling is amazing. The service was excellent. The food, each day, was great! A wide range of items on the buffet."
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,Spectacular place and incredible and varied buffet. Opera is always a plus. The variety and quality of the food is impressive.
La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"Eating in the hotel rotunda, under that wonderful glass dome, is a pleasure that can be found in few places. The food was splendid, highlighting some wonderful Iberian ham croquettes and some very delicious candied artichokes. For the main course I would highlight some really good grilled scallops with venere rice. For dessert, the cheesecake was good but nothing to write home about. The unbeatable service, very attentive and friendly."

La Cúpula Restaurant & Bar,Madrid,4.3,"Expansive plazas, local and foreign crowds, street performers, colorful lights, window shopping, restaurant signs promising the best paella, ham, and churros con chocolate- this is downtown Madrid, a collection of plazas interconnected by a network of side streets. Some of these side streets are wide pedestrian shopping routes, and some are hidden, so it's possible to duck in and out of the bustle as desired. The iconic Puerta del Sol is the giant crossroads of the city and a must-see attraction at any time of the day. The nearby Plaza Mayor, completely enclosed by historic red buildings, is an ideal place to grab a bite to eat outside, amidst scores of tables and people out for a stroll. Plaza Isabel II (also known as “Opera”) is smaller and a good meeting spot, and the stately Plaza del Oriente is the front yard of the Royal Palace. Centro can be touristy (pickpockets are unfortuately not unheard-of here), crowded, and sometimes gimmicky, but it is also the place to experience classic Madrid."

El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Tripadvisor is not responsible for this summary or the opinions in it. For more information, please read the traveler reviews and learn more about how the site works."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,Excellent food in a quiet unpretentious restaurant. All the dishes we had including octopus were perfectly cooked. Service was very good and the prices reasonable. The only slight criticism which prevented a 5 star from us was the limited selection of wines. Would definitely visit again.
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Muchas gracias por su reseña y por sus amables palabras sobre la comida y la cena; nos alegra enormemente saber que su experiencia fue tan positiva. En cuanto a la carta de vinos, agradecemos su comentario. Actualmente trabajamos con vinos de 14 variedades de uva distintas, seleccionadas con mucho cuidado. No obstante, debido al espacio del que disponemos en el restaurante, la ampliación de la bodega es algo que en parte se nos escapa de las manos. Aun así, seguimos esforzándonos por ofrecer opciones de calidad y un buen asesoramiento. Esperamos volver a recibirle muy pronto.

Thank you very much for your review and for your kind words about both the food and dinner; we are truly delighted to know that your experience was so positive. Regarding our wine list, we appreciate your feedback. We currently work with wines made from 14 different grape varieties, all carefully selected. However, due to the limited space available in our restaurant, expanding the wine cellar is something that is partly beyond our control. Even so, we continue to strive to offer quality options and provide good advice. We hope to welcome you back very soon."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Great spot for a quality meal a little outside the touristy areas, that is near parque Rio Madrid, another must see. Work up and appetite and walk from the Royal Palace to Puente Monumental De Arganzuela stopping here along the way. Great food, and friendly service!"
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Delicious food, very good service, always clean. 

Gabriel is a sweetheart. He always pampers my little ones and makes us feel like we are home! Andrea is also divine! It really is a very friendly team!!!"

El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,10/10 waiters' treatment and great quality food! I recommend cheesecake

El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Excellent quality 
We really liked the cheesecake 
And the prawn salad and the tenderloin very good"
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,Food and atmosphere of ten. I highly recommend the croquettes and dessert without doubt the torrija. Very friendly waiters
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Great staff, professional owner and always attentive to needs. 
Spectacular food and nothing expensive."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"A happy island for eyes and palate. If you only have one dinner available, come here."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Intrigued by the reviews, I had booked a dinner with my wife at this atypical restaurant. Atypical because it is completely decentralized and placed at an anonymous intersection. You have to go there specially since there is nothing around at all. The restaurant externally is a bit anonymous, there is only a sheltered terrace for those who want to eat out. We had booked inside but it was also December. The manager, immediately very kind and with whom we immediately got in tune, advised and briefed us on the different dishes. We also asked for a local white wine. I wanted something different than usual and it succeeded.
What about, it was all really delicious, with dishes prepared with great care and really good. I took some pictures but they don't give the idea of our excellent gastronomic evening. Also the wine recommended to me was very good. The service was nice and fast and throughout the dinner, despite the place was full, we were several faces questioned to our liking.
If I had only one night available in Madrid, I would return to this informal and surprising place. Not to be missed."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,Quality food and great service. To repeat. Varied menu and all very good. You can tell it's cooked all with quality products
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,Rich humus and quantity. Broken eggs with real potatoes and nice ham. Cheesecake that melts. All delicious

Taberna Pirámide,Madrid,4.9,"Booked here as it was close to our hotel on busy New Years Eve. Lovely welcome by fab lady who was host, bar lady, waitress & server all in one. Not sure how she did everything whilst she kept smilling. We asked if we could move tables. The very pleasant man (manager? ) obliged. Food lovely. Garlic prawns, octopus mushroom risotto all good. Restaurant bit cold but then its winter! All in all we had a lovely evening. The staff made it!"
Taberna Pirámide,Madrid,4.9,"We went there as a group following positive reviews.
After the first resistances for the not very inviting external appearance,
we had a great time both for the praiseworthy welcome and for the quality of the food.

Taberna Pirámide,Madrid,4.9,"I don't know how this restaurant got 4.9 stars, nor 4 $$$$. This is a hole-in-the-wall on a side street that serves ok food for fairly low prices. If you need dinner fast and cheap, and you aren't picky, it will do that. Service is friendly and prompt. 
We had mushroom croquettes, paella mariscos, and huevos con patatas y pisto. Definitely none of these were freshly made from raw ingredients. It's worth the effort to find an alternative dining option."

Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,Some of the best Italian I have had and I have been to Italy. This little place has a great Linguine alle Vongole and delicious Tiramisu. A real jewel in the neighborhood.
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,I loved the pizza 4 formaggi and the Manga juice and the salad of salmon burrata that my family ate and also the tagliatelli mass with pesto sauce that we ate.👍
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"Everything great, both the food and the attention received! a pleasure to always come here! The value for money is excellent, I have been coming to this place for many years!"
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"Very friendly staff, great attention. The place is very good, there is no noise, the music is low. Very rich food at affordable price"
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,Very good service and food would repeat a visit to this establishment without hesitation dessert was very rich
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"Very good food, quiet place and friendly Service! We ordered the pizza di Boscoz the Tagliatelle di campagna and the jewel the corana: the tentazione al forno. Wonderful!"
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"We went to this place because of its very good reviews.
The most remarkable thing, by far, is the attention of the waitresses, who are soletes at all times.
The food is good, but there are much better Italians. They also add pomodoro sauce to everything when many Italian recipes do not carry it.
The price is reasonable and the service wonderful."
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"All very rich and the waiters very attentive and nice 
We ordered a pizza, a pasta and a dessert and I end up very happy"
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"Great, quality food and great.
Very friendly staff, fast Service.
Good Mood, quiet and pleasant.
To repeat"
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"All very good, I hope to come back some more, super nice staff!!
Both pizza and pasta were very good, the desserts great!"
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"Good food, well presented, in a family run. Nice location with about 40 seats. They're not Italian... but they try!"
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"We came for the comments but we were disappointed. We ordered the cheese fondutta (lots of cream and little cheese), some gnochi (I tasted like a tomato from a boat) and 2 pasta dishes (both greasy, with lots of oil at the end). The price was economical (with water just under 20€ per person) but with the greasy food we got a bit of a bad body (and it was not especially tasty either). To get rid of hunger well, but not to savor a meal away from home."
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,The Sicilian donkey very rich and the staff very friendly. The whimsical pizza was great. The price is very good and we hope to return soon.
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"Ariel's Spectacular Food, Service and Attention!!!!
100% recommended!!! Pizza, pasta, everything!!!!! Cheese fondue wow !!!!"
Bosque De Piamonte,Madrid,4.9,"Excellent Service.

El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Tripadvisor is not responsible for this summary or the opinions in it. For more information, please read the traveler reviews and learn more about how the site works."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,Excellent food in a quiet unpretentious restaurant. All the dishes we had including octopus were perfectly cooked. Service was very good and the prices reasonable. The only slight criticism which prevented a 5 star from us was the limited selection of wines. Would definitely visit again.
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Muchas gracias por su reseña y por sus amables palabras sobre la comida y la cena; nos alegra enormemente saber que su experiencia fue tan positiva. En cuanto a la carta de vinos, agradecemos su comentario. Actualmente trabajamos con vinos de 14 variedades de uva distintas, seleccionadas con mucho cuidado. No obstante, debido al espacio del que disponemos en el restaurante, la ampliación de la bodega es algo que en parte se nos escapa de las manos. Aun así, seguimos esforzándonos por ofrecer opciones de calidad y un buen asesoramiento. Esperamos volver a recibirle muy pronto.

Thank you very much for your review and for your kind words about both the food and dinner; we are truly delighted to know that your experience was so positive. Regarding our wine list, we appreciate your feedback. We currently work with wines made from 14 different grape varieties, all carefully selected. However, due to the limited space available in our restaurant, expanding the wine cellar is something that is partly beyond our control. Even so, we continue to strive to offer quality options and provide good advice. We hope to welcome you back very soon."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Great spot for a quality meal a little outside the touristy areas, that is near parque Rio Madrid, another must see. Work up and appetite and walk from the Royal Palace to Puente Monumental De Arganzuela stopping here along the way. Great food, and friendly service!"
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Delicious food, very good service, always clean. 

Gabriel is a sweetheart. He always pampers my little ones and makes us feel like we are home! Andrea is also divine! It really is a very friendly team!!!"
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"All very rich and the waiters very friendly. 
100% recommended prawn risoto"
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Outside the town, you’ll go by taxi, but everything is fresh and beautiful, especially the seafood was very good"
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,The staff had a friendly and unparalleled meal experience! The store was clean. I want to go one more time while in Madrid. Thank you.
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,Fantastic night and dinner at El Sueno de Carmen. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Highly recommend. The staff also was exceptional. Thank you Gabriel for a fantastic evening. You were great!
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,10/10 waiters' treatment and great quality food! I recommend cheesecake
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"We've been here several times. 
Very good service and exquisite food.!!
Today they had as a suggestion octopus croquettes (very good)"
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Excellent quality 
We really liked the cheesecake 
And the prawn salad and the tenderloin very good"
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,Food and atmosphere of ten. I highly recommend the croquettes and dessert without doubt the torrija. Very friendly waiters
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Great staff, professional owner and always attentive to needs. 
Spectacular food and nothing expensive."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"A happy island for eyes and palate. If you only have one dinner available, come here."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,"Intrigued by the reviews, I had booked a dinner with my wife at this atypical restaurant. Atypical because it is completely decentralized and placed at an anonymous intersection. You have to go there specially since there is nothing around at all. The restaurant externally is a bit anonymous, there is only a sheltered terrace for those who want to eat out. We had booked inside but it was also December. The manager, immediately very kind and with whom we immediately got in tune, advised and briefed us on the different dishes. We also asked for a local white wine. I wanted something different than usual and it succeeded.
What about, it was all really delicious, with dishes prepared with great care and really good. I took some pictures but they don't give the idea of our excellent gastronomic evening. Also the wine recommended to me was very good. The service was nice and fast and throughout the dinner, despite the place was full, we were several faces questioned to our liking.
If I had only one night available in Madrid, I would return to this informal and surprising place. Not to be missed."
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,Quality food and great service. To repeat. Varied menu and all very good. You can tell it's cooked all with quality products
El Sueño De Carmen,Madrid,4.9,Rich humus and quantity. Broken eggs with real potatoes and nice ham. Cheesecake that melts. All delicious

Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,Buenas tardes. Me gustaría saber si se puede reservar mesa. Muchas gracias. Un saludo.
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,We found the place by chance and the truth that surprised us. We ordered the 30cm board with its 8 sauces and it razed. Exquisite she was. Recommended.
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,We found the place by chance and the truth that surprised us. Exquisite food. No reservations allowed. The atmosphere is very quiet.
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"We went for a bite and loved the board. The meat (sirloin and chicken) was tender and very juicy. Surprised us for good. Very nice Mood and normal prices, which in Madrid is appreciated"
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"I went to dinner with a friend on a hot July night that became refreshing thanks to the very fresh beers they divinely throw there. For dinner we ordered one of their famous boards (already told me about them by other friends who know the site) and... wou!! Spending little money we dined deliciously and spent a very fun evening because it deserves mention apart its friendly and friendly staff, especially Antonio, who is the Soul of this place. We'll be back!!"
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,The friendly waitress and he rather unpleasant man.Very poor ways to attend. Site too small and we went for Instagram referrals and expectations are not met.
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"Excellent service, very friendly and friendly staff.
Delicious food and very cupid atmosphere, good music. We had to wait something to get in, because it's small, but the wait was worth it."
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,A fantastic place but so small that you have to fight for a table and hole in the bar...but to come back again and again
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"Came on Tripadvisor recommendation and was very pleased. Needed a late lunch after an early flight via Amsterdam 

Delighted with the recommendation. Fast and friendly service. Good “vibes” about the place 

Good beer on tap

Had the recommendation of Torero Tostas (Solomillo, Ceballo Caramelized y Brie) - roughly translated as beef tenderloin and caramelized onions on toast - with a side of chips and aioli 

So good! 

Very satisfied. 

Here on a robotic surgery conference for a couple of days but really hope I get an opportunity to come back before I leave 

Thoroughly recommended"
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"I don't really understand where the high rating of this place comes from. It's true that it is nice, but the food leaves a lot to be desired, they serve giant plates of potatoes with meat and various sauces, ideal for students, but little else. The rest The tapas are medium-low quality, with a lot of frying and batter. They give you double canes that are heated at all, I really don't understand this trend, they don't give the option of small canes."
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,Small place so you need to squeeze in but good food and drinks. I like the location and the value for money and the food has never let me down!
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"Very delicious and perfect service. I have never ever eaten such good meat. It looks inside more like a pub and could be underestimated, but it's perfec and also local people eat there. Try yourself!"
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"Great little bar/restaurant we found close to our hotel. Served great burgers for the children and my wife and I had their recommended dish - a choice of meats and sauces on a bed of fries. It was so delicious, bery flavoursome and would definitely have again. Reasonably priced as well. Would recommend. Thank you"
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"Amazing food, good prize and good atmosphere! Such a cozy place! Even for one person, the tablas is always a really nice option"
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"Really good food. Don’t go here on a health kick, but the flavor is great. You basically pick 2/4/6/8 sauces to go with your plate of French fries or French fries and 2 meats. They have vegan/vegetarian options with the beyond meat, but it’s more expensive than the regular. 

Fantastic service. The bartender made sure I had everything I needed.

Pretty small place so you might have to wait"
Gandarío,Madrid,4.7,"Plan to have dinner there with colleagues, first entered the place at 19:45, no table for 3. My colleague decided to walk around for other places, did not manage to find a decent one, came back at 20:05, this time, no seating at all. I was so hungry and decided to order the food here as takeaway instead. No sign of member of staff for 5 minutes and no English menu to view
Finally the waiter came out and I asked for the English menu who does exist. I chose hamburger option 1 for 8 euros as takeaway. After about 15 minutes I finally got my food. When I got back to Hotel Exe Moncloa which is 4-5 minutes walk, the burger itself is not warm, the burger felt soggy as well as the buns. The sauces does taste nice. The french fries was salty, very disappointed."

Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,This was the best meal i have had in agenda werkers were super kind and nice the food waa unbelievable i wil be dressing about this for ages
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,Entre Santos is not just a restaurant — it’s a love letter to gastronomy.
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Every time we visit Madrid, it’s the one place we cannot resist. The food is nothing short of extraordinary — not a single dish is ever ‘ordinary’ or predictable. Each plate carries a story, a twist, a spark of creativity, and is built from ingredients that are clearly of the highest quality.

The dedication and passion of the kitchen can be tasted in every bite, and the warmth of the staff is felt the moment you walk through the door. They are not only professional but genuinely lovely, making every guest feel special and at home.

And then, the cocktails — perfection in a glass, crafted with the same care and imagination as the dishes.

In our eyes, Entre Santos is the embodiment of what dining should be: creativity without pretension, excellence without compromise, and hospitality that comes from the heart. It is a rare gem that, without question, deserves a Michelin star. Until that day comes, it will remain our star in Madrid."
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Went in with high expectations and left just a little disappointed. On the whole, good, interesting food but not great food. Example: the shrimp ceviche, which I’ve eaten all over the world. Interesting presentation, but the shrimp just tasted off. The beef tenderloin bites proved tasty, but were overwhelmed by the potato chip flavor of the frites. The Chicken Mohammed, on the other hand, was interesting, innovative, and delicious. Same with the Entre Santos mocktail. Fun, but often distracted servers made for a bit disjointed meal."
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Service was amazing!!! I love all the waiters they made this experience amazing! Ask for Charlie and Kevin. Food amazing, drinks amazing, love it all."
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,I loved it. It was really good food and it looks like the staff really had fun and a good working environment so I really recommend this place.
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Very nice tapas address, superb and warm decor, delicious tapas, only flat the service, surely victim of its success, the service is very minimalist, bordering on sufficiency, shame but delicious food..."
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Great food, spectacular cocktails and Caesar with all his equipment, a luxury! It's the fifth time we've come and come back."
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Food is very tasty, especially the piece of meat is recommended. The cheeses are also very tasty in between. Cocktails in many variations go well with the food"
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Fantastic tapas and cocktail bar. Staff are brilliant and the tapas are the tastiest I’ve ever had. Amazing flavours and textures, with generous portion size. Really creative dishes, served in a vibrant and buzzing environment. Would happily recommend and look forward to a return visit."
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,Top tasty tapas…laid back and unassuming back street bar that delivered on every front. From tasty tapas dishes to friendly bar staff with a cool local vibe!
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"I think this was unexpectedly the best food ever!
In my opinion, really stars level, we didn't expect at all when we came into this, actually inconspicuous, store. There was really nothing wrong, the waiters were also very friendly and attentive. If I could I would come back regularly. Value for money really hammer."
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Comments aren’t stolen at all ... I think it’s one of the best dining experiences of my life at equivalent prices. Everything is delectable, atmosphere, service (effective without being oppressive)
The dishes are fantastic, we are not at all in a classic taverna. It is worked. Acid-grad balances are perfect. The creamy-melting-crunchy scales are present. Typically hibernate raised/spicy touches are subtle. Even the cutlery and dishes are unique. 
I could not make you want more but rush with your eyes closed and let you guide!!
After a few exchanges with the hyper friendly staff, the chef travelled around the world before putting his bags here and it feels on the plate"
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Great food, but the waiters beautiful and very nice. I would come back for sure!!!!!! Alejandro, a sweetheart."
Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,LOVED everything about this place!! The staff was so much fun and welcoming. The drinks were cheap &amazing and the food was to die for!! My favorite was the ceviche and chimichurri steak (not picture) but would order the croquetas again.

Entre Santos Cocktail Bar & Food,Madrid,4.9,"Expansive plazas, local and foreign crowds, street performers, colorful lights, window shopping, restaurant signs promising the best paella, ham, and churros con chocolate- this is downtown Madrid, a collection of plazas interconnected by a network of side streets. Some of these side streets are wide pedestrian shopping routes, and some are hidden, so it's possible to duck in and out of the bustle as desired. The iconic Puerta del Sol is the giant crossroads of the city and a must-see attraction at any time of the day. The nearby Plaza Mayor, completely enclosed by historic red buildings, is an ideal place to grab a bite to eat outside, amidst scores of tables and people out for a stroll. Plaza Isabel II (also known as “Opera”) is smaller and a good meeting spot, and the stately Plaza del Oriente is the front yard of the Royal Palace. Centro can be touristy (pickpockets are unfortuately not unheard-of here), crowded, and sometimes gimmicky, but it is also the place to experience classic Madrid."

Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"Bonjour, Est ce que c'est possible de ne pas d'avoir d'huile sur la viande, ou le.poisson et sur les légumes?"
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,i whas looking through the menu on the website and can see the prices... but are these prices per 100 grams ? id really love to know about the prices...
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,Although really expensive the experience was amazing. For the meat lovers to have the opportunity to taste amazing cuts and compare them paired with a good wine in Japanese style is unique. Service was also really good.
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"For our last night in Berlin we looked for something different for our evening meal. This restaurant won’t let you down (if you like meat)

Great setting and atmosphere from the restaurant. Staff explained the process well and the food was delicious. Well worth a trip.

No alcohol free beers though"
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"I celebrated my birthday there, with family and friends. It was very pleasant, the service super friendly, was always at the table, we could order constantly something without waiting long. We were told the cleanliness, the meat, the grill, what to consider. The staff were competent and knew what they were doing. On them I saw that the whole team, boss, kitchen work well together and a harmonious atmosphere prevails. The meat was a feast for the eyes, served so beautifully and trained on the tellen. The taste, heavenly. I'm rather pretty, but this beef, which can also grill without spices, top quality and there too even yourself. That's as good as it gets. In total, we were supposed to be 11 people, in the end we were 5, normal white ones stay aif the costs, of course we would still have fried the meat and taken it with us, but the chef could use it differently, so I did not have to pay the rest, also there for thanks.
Thanks to the whole team, it was a wonderful evening, we are still struggling today from :D it was something very special."
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"A big thank you for this great discovery!
We absolutely loved our experience. We chose a set menu, which was more than enough in terms of quantity. We received all the necessary explanations on how to use the grill properly. Special thanks to the kind waitress who took the time to give us helpful tips for our upcoming trip to Japan. A delicious and enriching experience!"
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"It was good. Cannot complain on the service or the quality of the food. The wagyu and black angus were truly fresh and juicy. The ambiance was clean, chic and serene. 

It is suitable for groups. But also, for couples. One thing to know is - they don't serve coffee. That's all.

So all in all, good place."
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"The food was great and the staff was fantastic! 
My girlfriend loved the blue lychee drink, and we had to buy some extra of the dipping sauce to bring home because it was simply that good."
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"Appears like an authentic Japanese BBQ. The room and the seats are somewhat sterile and therefore do not become a place you might sit longer than you have to.

Good selection of meat.
We chose mixed menu for 53 € per person, then you get with rice and a very small portion of vegetables on sharing. The meat was fantastic, but there was too little food in general and at that price. Accessories of sides cost 6 € and are also small portions.
Good food experience, but price and total experience make us probably not coming back."
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"amazing in every aspect: food, service, interior. excellent. recommend to everyone. Had a delightful dinner with my family at this place. We tried wagyu, seafood and most of the american meat as well as pork belly and different salads. Every single thing was absolutely delicious. And I think this sums up this restaurant pretty well."
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,We ate well even though we did not have high expectations. The place is not particularly welcoming. The Owner is in the kitchen and takes the utmost care in preparing the dishes. All good and freshly cooked.
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"The place is black! Ceiling, walls, floor - I don't like it at all - like in a tomb.
The meat is grilled at the table, which makes it very hot.
Prices are excessive !!! A kilo of Waguy is charged about 900€, which is a bad joke. The meat is quite tender because it is marbled with fat.
We paid 300€ for two, which was 150€ too much. Cardy rice costs 4,50€ extra, each dip or vegetable is charged separately, a glass of Primitivo 0,2 l hits with 14€. For me, the place is incomprehensible and not a place to draw me again !"
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"We have been here a few times now and we like it again and again. It is a bit annoying to reserve a table as it is not a real booking system. On site the service is always great. I recommend ordering food for larger groups, because everything is not always there in the desired quantity. 

Priced rather higher, but the quality is usually really good. Once we had the garlic marinated meat in the pot so greasy that none of us could eat it."
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"Overpriced for the quality. Side dishes poorly prepared and inadequate. For three people, a total of 3 mushrooms, 3 slices of zucchini and 3 small pieces of pumpkin. Insufficient amount of sauces. We cannot recommend a visit."
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,An experience you absolutely must try if you are a meat lover. Very helpful and friendly staff. High prices but proportionate to the food you are tasting.🔝
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"We were told everything on the menu, how to grill the food, the accompanying dips, and the homemade soy sauce was very tasty. It was a relaxed evening. A little more expensive, but we're happy to pay more for the good quality."
Ushido - Japanese BBQ,Berlin,4.5,"Worst service ever starting from the booking on the website where it at the end of the “acceptance of my request” mail states a standard talk/talk about they will get back to the customer in 48h….. where other restaurants have their booking online, Ushido may benefit from moving into the 21st century on this point. 
I hadn’t head any thing I was surprised to get mail only 6 hours this “round birthday dinner” telling me that there was no seat tonight, as I was getting ready for the evening. 
When I called the restaurant to try to get confirmation or see if I could have a different time I spoke with an English speaking man heavy German accent who said quote begin “I cannot and I will not help you” continuing in a most sarcastic tone “have a nice birthday” quote end he cut ten connection immediately after making the sarcastic remark. 
So I can’t comment on the food but only hope service in the restaurant is more professional. 
No I won’t bother to book this restaurant again BERLIN is full of nice restaurants with the service in top."

PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,go there hungry otherwise you will not cope with the amount of food you will served
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"This restaurant is incredible; the vibe, the service and the food of course, see other reviews for the food reviews as I'd just repeat them. I'm not at all adventurous in my food choices and so this really stressed my brain/pallet but all for no reason. 10/10; incredible"
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"Went here in a group of 7 and it was great. Very helpful staff suggesting how many dishes to order and friendly throughout. Food and venue were great and drinks good. 
We booked and suggest you do too if you want to guarantee table"
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,Visited this restaurant on our first night in Berlin. We made a reservation as the reviews were great and we didn’t want to miss out by not getting a table! We weren’t disappointed. The concept of German food served tapas style was brilliant and the food was amazing. Our server was Jonas: he was really helpful and his recommendations for both the food and wine were spot on. He’s a real credit to the restaurant and really made our evening. Would definitely recommend a meal here.
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,An outstanding evening. The software phenomenal and service was superb. I would hire recommend to anyone who wants to have German cuisine in a different style on their trip to Berlin
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"Friendly and helpful from the start. The German tapas offering was varied, interesting and flavoursome. Great wine too. Helpful, personal and friendly service."
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"An atmospheric German restaurant near Alexanderplatz.Decor superb.Staff extremely attentive and take a long time going through the menu with us.Traditional German food served tapas style.As an example choose say cheese filled dumpling with slow cooked beef.Then do the same with other choices.Great experience,lovely staff great atmosphere and not expensive.hard was staggering back to underground one stop from Alexanderplatz."
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"We've come on our honeymoon to Berlin and wanted to have a really nice dining experience whilst out, dressed up and wanting to try something unique- after researching we decided on PeterPaul, for the really interesting menu and fine dining small plates concept on traditional German cuisine. We didn't quite know what to expect but wanted something different. I'm so glad we decided on this place- the staff were absolutely brilliant, so attentive, personable and you can tell they really have a passion for what they do and take great pride in what they have going at the restaurant. The venue itself was very cool- in an effortless, inner city style, gave an exclusive and sexy feel but not in a pretentious way. We were recommended a few dishes as we wanted to try as many different flavour profiles and we weren't pushed to have too many- just recommended the perfect amount. Absolutely divine food. So many interesting flavours, textures and combinations. We also enjoyed a really nice bottle of Reisling - great wine menu for those who enjoy a glass. Thanks for making our evening so enjoyable PeterPaul team! Will recommend to any friends next coming to Berlin. X"
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"Nice restaurant Good food! We ate currywurst, sild, Roastbiff and chicken. German food in Tapas format Very good😊Recommended at the hottest"
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"This is an absolute Hidden Gem in Berlin- 2nd Visit and it was even better
The Ambience, Buzz, Decor and Staff are all superb
The food is simply sensational
Nice Wines
Clemens the Maitre D' was very attentive and really made our visit special
Excellent Value for money- especially if you live in Dublin!"
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"Have a nice evening during a long weekend in Berlin. Absolutely recommended. Delicious dishes, fine portions and beautiful matching wines. More than excellent value for money. Funny that the co-pilot of the restaurant turned out to speak Dutch."
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"I can only agree with the positive reviews before me: very nice, attentive Service and very delicious food!"
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"Absolutely not to be missed, if you come to Berlin you absolutely must try this place, it is the best we have eaten in! Dishes are carefully curated with balanced flavors, I absolutely recommend the cheesy dumings, potato salad and Berlin-style meatballs, all really delicious. We also had a bottle of local Pinot Noir. The staff is really genital, helpful and courteous. We spent about € 50 per person with a total of about 8/9 dishes and a bottle of wine, the price is absolutely worth it and reflects the quality of the restaurant, three dishes we took twice from how delicious they were! The cuisine is traditional German but reinterpreted in a modern key, the portions are a middle ground between tapas and normal dish, so you can taste and share with friends or family more dishes and try new tastes!
Really highly recommended, go there!!!"
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"Nice place, friendly staff but too expensive for what you get. € 11 for a curry sausage 🙈 or € 18 for 2 pieces of meat"
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"Overall, the experience was fairly good. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was pleasant. However, there were a few aspects that could be improved — some details felt a bit overlooked, and the quality didn’t fully meet expectations. Still, it was enjoyable enough, and with a few adjustments, it could easily be great. Worth a try!"
PeterPaul,Berlin,4.6,"Classic German food served elegantly as a sharing menu. The food is tasty, with small interpretations and still true to the German origin. 
The fifth star is for truly carried out and attentive service, with great love for the food, the wine, the place and the guest.
Here I will come back the next time I visit Berlin."

Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"I note this establishment has 2 Michelin Stars. It has a restaurant and winebar. Is there a difference in quality of food? I am quite particular with what i eat so the restaurant tasting menu is not for me but the winebar looks very good. I'm just looking to find out, would i know i was dining in a 2 star restaurant if i was in the winebar Thank you"
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"Vielen Dank für ihr Feedback, wir haben uns ihrer Kretik angenommen und besprochen. Schöne Grüße aus dem Rutz und vllt. bis bald! Ihr Rutz Team"
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"Mein Lieber Herr Rolf A. M., wir bedanken uns für eine so konstruktive Kritik und nehmen mal von einigen ihner genannten Punkte Abstand. Was wir nicht hinnehmen ist ihr Ansatz, denn wenn sie sich genauso gut auf dieses Event vorbereitet hätten wie wir, hätten sie gewusst dass das Rutz 2 Gastronomien unter einem Dach betreibt, zur einen eine Weinbar & zu anderen das darüber liegende 2 Sterne Restaurant, also gut bürgerlich & Avantgarde. Dann hätten sie auch gewusst dass das Rutz mit seiner kleinen Bodenständigen Weinbar unterwegs war und nicht mit seinem Restaurant und damit auch zu keiner Zeit der Anspruch bestand der 2 Sterneküche gerecht zu werden. Seine Bodenständige aber äußerst produktsichere Küche passte für uns sehr gut zu diesem Weingut. Aber sicherlich haben sie das in der Bewerbung der Veranstaltung großzügig überlesen. Was sie aber richtig verstanden haben ist, das wir das besondere im Produkt suchen, das Huhn von einem Züchter aus unserer Region stammt und dieses von so außer gewöhnlich guter Qualität ist, das man damit keinen Schnick Schnack betreiben muss. Des Weiteren sollten sie verstehen, dass wir unsere Fische, unser Fleisch fast ausschließlich bei 60°C garen und servieren, was ein wirkliches heiß und sehr warm generell ausschließt, aber ein saftiges, butterzartes und glasiges Stück hervor bringt, die Produkte nicht trocken auslaufen und damit zäh macht, sondern den Eigenegeschmack bewahrt. Wir können uns auch sehr gut an ihren Tisch erinnern, da es von 400 servierten Menüs nur eine derartige Reklamation gab. Was den halbgefrorene Cheese Cake angeht liegen sie leider falsch, was sie beschreiben war in der Tat ein Halbgefrorenes, aber kein Cheese Cake sondern ein Parfait von der Lärche, was schon sehr außergewöhnlich ist, finden sie nicht auch. Der Cheese Cake an sich war eine Interpretation als Creme aufgespritzt & Amarettini Bröseln, kam übrigens sehr gut an. Also das Ganze hat also nichts mit Landeiern oder arroganten Berlinern zu tun, sondern schlicht weg mit Uninformiertheit ihrer Seits und mir scheint sie mögen unsere Art der Weinbarküche nicht und ok, man merkt auch einwenig ihre Unkenntnis in höheren Geschmacksfragen... was auch aus unserer Sicht vollkommen legitim ist. Vllt. kommen sie uns doch einmal in unserem Restaurant besuchen, wann sie interessiert was Herr Müller und sein Team zubereiten. Mit freundlichen Grüßen, ihr Rutz Team"
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"Certainly the best michelin restaurant out of the 5 we tried this week in Berlin, deserve all 3 stars

The set menu is long with 13 courses and it took 4 hours. Every course is very good to excellent, not easy. Unlike many other michelin restaurants , the staff are friendly and knowledgeable"
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"One of the best Michelin-starred restaurant experiences I’ve ever had. The appetizers, main courses and wine pairing was simply exquisite !"
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"Skip this ""so called"" 3-star restaurant and to spend your money somewhere else"
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"This restaurant is probably the worst Michelin ""starred"" one and we have been to many of them. To start, the food was mediocre and once the fish dishes were done, they served a beet root as a transition to other dish. This root dish was so salty that cannot be eaten. Server knew and didn't do anything or say anything. Then following all the dishes, another 3 were so salty that they were left untouched. The gelatin on top of the chicken liver was the worst in term of saltiness. When the server came to collect the dish, she looked at it and ""said I know.."" I asked to hold salt on the beef, but just about barely edible. I am not sure how such food quality can receive 3-star rating. 
I might be personal, but a dinner after over US1,000, this shouldn't be the case. Also, I was very reluctant to tip after dinner, but the server stood next to you and kept reminding the guests that tips was extra. Goodness! I was forced to tip, what a terrible experience."
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,Horny 3 star treat stamp in our capital Berlin and has been for 24 years 👏
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"Moin Folks,

Moin Folks,

a few years ago I was already here and now with my best friends and it was trumpet galactically awesome here 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
The welcome was already very attentive and accommodating, then up to the first floor and there the same table as then, Hammergeil👍
The big course menu has kept what it promised via menu 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩In this year, the pleasure was the highlight so far, thank you.👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Next year will certainly be even better, then 25 years Restaurant Rutz, I can only recommend it with my friends 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"

Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"I've been wanting to go there for a long time, now we've been there. The fact that there is a shortened menu recently, we find great and were immediately ""in."" However, our expectations - and also many experiences - of a 3-star restaurant were not met: Wrongly printed menu, wine - we had the drink accompaniment - which absolutely did not taste us to the course - a really outstanding beetroot dish. We were ""jilted"" in front of full glasses, which were then fully cleared even without any demand. At the next table - wine accompaniment - a chardonnay was served with the dish, which we could have imagined - and if there had been an extra charge, this would also have gladly paid. But: We were not asked and unfortunately there was no service team around us at the time that we could have asked for it.
As a digestif, we were handed another actually sparkling drink - we can't remember exactly what it was - but that unfortunately lay completely lifeless in the glass. 
But there was someone from the Service nearby, the drink was immediately exchanged without much demand - was also obvious.
The food itself: good, but not extraordinary or something that sticks in the memory. Neither of the preparation nor of the ingredient or taste.
A nice evening. Now we were there once. But: We won't be back, but it wasn't impressive - we expect that with 3 stars - enough and there are also so many other restaurants to discover."
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"The expectations of the 3-star restaurant were more than met for us. Cool location, pleasantly spacious tables with space and spacing, uncomplicated Service - and on the plate one taste explosion after another, all light and fresh without butter or heaviness. Super wine list with surprisingly moderate pricing. For us after the Cheval Blanc / Basel the greatest 3-star hotel. Prima! Thank you."
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"The food was excellent, especially the fish dishes were awesome. The non-alcoholic beverage accompaniment was very innovative and good."
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"Not worthy of a three-macaroon restaurant. Plate level one macaron and service / room level two macarons (and again)

If I take the imposed evening menu:
Re-hydrated tomato & redwood tree - uninteresting tomato but remarkable broth
Oyster & green strawberry - very good
Baked fish & Dill - very nice
MAGNOLIA & YELLOWTAIL MACKEREL, rhubarb - I didn't like it at all
BEETROOT & HORSERADISH, sumac - bon
LEEKS, ONIONS & POTATO, pepperweed - bon
GARDEN PEAS & ASPARAGUS, chicken skin - I didn't particularly like it
WILD GARLIC, BUNTES BENTHEIMER & Koji - I didn't particularly like it
WAGYU & GARUM, Kohlrabi - exceptional, only dish really up to dinner
DRY AGED LAMB & BUN, BEANS - not bad
Truffle & buckwheat - cool and nice
FENNEL & VERBENA, clementine - I didn't like it at all
Knotweed & pink - I didn't like it at all

No cuteness: this is not allowed in a three Michelin macarons (especially after technical desserts more than gourmet)"
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"We visited Rutz in Berlin (3 Michelin stars) during the Easter weekend 2025. The reception and service were good, the atmosphere okay, although the overall look felt somewhat businesslike and distant.

As for the food: disappointing for a three-star establishment. The balance of flavours was often not right – several dishes were far too salty, while others were far too acidic. In terms of structure and presentation, there was no excitement or innovation. Each dish consisted of one element with a sauce served separately. Compared to other star-studded stores we visited earlier, this was clearly lagging behind.

The price is exceptionally high. We knew this beforehand, but it is precisely because of this that the bar is also considerably higher. At this price range you expect special ingredients or pronounced techniques, but they were largely lacking.

In a city like Berlin, there are plenty of alternatives where you will be surprised more culinary for less money."
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"Money may govern many things, but it buys neither style nor decency. A 3-star restaurant stands for the highest culinary art, first-class service and a special atmosphere. Anyone who goes there should have respect not only for the food but also for the work of the cooks and staff.

Short trousers and bathing slippers destroy this very atmosphere. Fine dining is not only a matter of taste, but also of experience. Anyone who shows up in sweatpants or beach outfit shows that they don’t care about this experience – and that’s disrespectful to all other guests who have deliberately chosen this ambience.

Style and decency do not mean you have to dine in a suit, but a certain level of care should be taken for granted. Money alone doesn’t make a gentleman – it shows in attitude, respect and behaviour.
Mr Müller doesn’t care, everyone is welcome , there could be a potential CIO or higher behind every “casual outfit”. Money rules the world!"
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"The disappointment began with the entree, with the music. Annoyingly South American, irritatingly close to the threshold of hearing. Mood killer. The ambience careless and very boring. Bald and matter-of-fact can be good, see Cookies Cream, but at Rutz it looks more like a canteen. You'd need a good interior designer. The fuller the store, the louder it got, which sometimes made a conversation exhausting. We like star restaurants with more distance to the neighboring tables, because space also means luxury. Clearly listening to the conversations of the businessmen next door is not.

We had chosen the 8-course veggie menu, without wine accompaniment, which already raised eyebrows. Greetings from the kitchen were exciting and promised excellent. Then, however, things continued rather less spectacularly. The kitchen is undoubtedly creative. Something is on offer to the eye, kitchen with tweezers. But we missed the special, extraordinary taste. We found the “truffle” upgrade of an aisle particularly annoying. A dish with a few slices of black winter truffles that had little of their own taste – for an extra 49 euros. 
The “Plum & Kernöl” dessert was one of the highlights, as was the final greeting from the “Autumn Prince & Green Juniper” kitchen.
The service was attentive from the beginning and quite professional. We wanted two particularly interesting glasses of wine from the sommelier. One was indeed, the other somehow arbitrary.
On our way home, we discussed whether we were simply too untrained in rating a 3-star kitchen (Das Rutz was only our 2. Experience), but in the end it matters whether you come out of a restaurant enthusiastically. The 2-star restaurant of the week before had set a benchmark for us that the Rutz clearly did not reach (anymore?). Our bill amounted to €890 – excluding tips."
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"The best we've ever experienced. Sustainable cuisine, local ingredients, taste variations never heard before, let alone tasted, embedded in perfect service around host Falco mills and perfectly coordinated wine recommendations."
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"I was bringing my mom to celebrate her retirement - her first three Michelin Star restaurant experience. The food is spectacular. The taste and dish presentation were on the nose. The problems I faced were with the service - things I have never experienced in other top-tier, three star restaurants. Some of these are inexcusable errors. I left highly disappointed.

First, we were told by our server that we get a taste before the pour so we thought this applied to all of our drinks rather than only the wines. When we were given our first non-alcoholic pairing, there was no instruction that this is the actual pair and not a taste, also the dish came about 10-15 minutes later so we drank it. The server who brought over the dish was confused because she did not see the pairing at our table and had to ask us whether we had already tried the catfish. We told her that we thought it was a tasting to see if we liked the drink so she had graciously gone to ask the somm whether we can have a refill with our dish. The somm had instructed our server that we could get a refill only if we wanted to pay extra. Granted it tasted great, the cost of making the vegetable juice is insignificant compared to wine.

Second, when we wanted to use the restroom, we were asked to wait until after the main course as it was coming soon. The service should be working around the guest, not the other way around.

Third, I noticed that I received the WRONG bill - it was more than what I am supposed to pay.

I've given this exact feedback to the restaurant when they emailed me for it. It's been over a week and have yet to receive any responses. This is yet another example of how service is lacking."
Rutz Restaurant - Weinbar,Berlin,4.3,"The visit to the Rutz (***) was absolutely extraordinary in every respect. Extraordinarily exciting because I have probably never eaten in such a high-class restaurant that has such a strong philosophy and lives. Exceptionally delicious, because nevertheless each dish simply tastes extremely good and often provides memories of tastes from childhood, for example. And exceptionally sympathetic, because you feel right in good hands in this beautiful restaurant, with chef Marco Müller, who presented and explained a course directly at the kitchen, and with the service team around restaurant manager Falco. Thank you for this fantastic evening!"

Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,Great food and friendly people. I really enjoyed the jollof rice with plantain and fried beef. I've tried it twice now and I never regret it
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,Order one of the homemade drinks. They're actually really good and exotic
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,Hallo. Wie grosse Gruppen koennen bei Ihnen auf einmal im Innenbereich bewirtet werden ?
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,"Great food for a reasonable price.
The portions could be a bit bigger.
Friendly service and nice atmosphere!
Can definetely recommend this place!"
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,"Actually, we came across the restaurant by chance because we stay nearby and we love the West African food. So we made reservations by phone. 
But what we experienced there surprised us. 
Bantabaa is incredibly authentic with the selection of food and drinks but the quality is at the highest level. 
If you still have such a courteous service and even the chef stops by... we only know that from other price ranges. 
The Bantabaa is really an insider tip and we will come back!
Thank you for the great evening at your place."
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,"We had reserved by phone, the restaurant was well attended but not overcrowded.
The staff served us very quickly and courteously. All food and drinks were very tasty and also visually appealing.
Very good value for money."
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,"The food is very delicious, balanced and varied! Just great! I can recommend the mixed plate for 2 people and the banana bread:)"

Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,"Very good, authentic food, very friendly atmosphere - I look forward to eating there again and recommend the restaurant very much!"
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,Excellent culinary journey to West Africa. Wonderful puff puff and Benachin with chicken. Hot sauce is indeed that. Charming place with outside seating.
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,"We had the mixed plate of different dishes and the pasta bag as a starter, which by the way was a 10 out of 10! Also very friendly and polite staff, only to recommend. 5 of 5"
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,"I had never had Gambian food before, and wow have I been missing out! My husband and I split the tour platter, which was a little bit of everything. It was absolutely delicious. We added chicken for more protein. What a terrific way to experience Berlin‘s cultural and culinary diversity. Highly recommend!!"
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,"Superb. We went for the sharing platter with mackerel and can’t fault any of it. So tasty, such a great combination of flavours. And the little bowl of hot sauce was one of the best I’ve ever had. When we come back to Berlin, we will be coming back here for sure."
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,Very good experience where you can taste delicious gambian food and drinks. Definitely a must if you are in Berlin. Fast service and moderate price.
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,Super super delicious!!! I love this kitchen 💞 it tastes great and the atmosphere is really nice too!!!!
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,First time trying Gambian food. It was delicious. I will definitely come back to try all the other dishes. Highly recommended
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,"The food is amazing, first time trying Gambian dishes and this is so delicious. Will definitely come back again !! Highly recommended !"
Bantabaa,Berlin,4.9,The food very tasty well seasoned and served quickly. The tea - cold or hot - especially recommended. Very nice are the starters. Something completely different.

Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Schade, solche Kommentare zu lesen die absolut unnötig sind und keinen etwas bringen. Konstruktive Kritik ist immer gut, aber hier lässt einfach nur jemand seinen Frust raus! Schade"
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,hi! i would like to make a reservation on 26.08. but can we make a birthday reservation? what can you offer? i would like to see if there’s also a menu or choice related to it such as a little celebration or cake will also be amazing. thankyou
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Excellent food!!! Poor service!
Venue good.. food was beautiful. Service poor overall. From start to finish- waiting staff made no EFFORT to go above and beyond. E.g. no warm welcome, slow service overall, no offer of wine menu (had to ask), no offer of sauce with steak, dessert, coffee, more drinks etc. Gave us bread, olives, water (although €8.50)… Lovely place, food was amazing!! The chef was the best thing there."
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"The food is good, the wines are great and the staff is excellent, very professional and very friendly. They really know how to make a party!"
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"A solid higher end restaurant. Design is great, very well thought out. Service was also solid. The food was otherwise great, but the scallop pizza tasted like nothing, the scallops need some seasoning."
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Excellent cuisine 
Excellent Service / generous! 
Excellent wines

Go on! This is already our second visit and we will return"
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,Am often here the Mood is unbeatable. The food is very nicely arranged and tastes very good at a fair price.
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"I dined on the terrace on a coated table, overlooking a beautiful bouquet of proteas.
The welcome is very smiling and I was offered a very nice table when I arrived an hour and a half before my booking time.
I enjoyed a dish of bluefin tuna snacked on a bed of avocado, accompanied by a truffle puree and small seasonal vegetables. A delight!
I had a glass of Primitivo, which I found particularly good (subtle, not too powerful).
Addition of 50 EUR.
A beautiful experience, to renew as a couple!"
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"It was a great evening! Very good food, thoughtful staff and a great atmosphere. Would definitely come back! Highly recommended."
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Perfect place, we come there directly from Albania , everything was perfect, food , service! Absolutely recomandet! 
10/10"
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Great quality and a very attentive service. We had the 4-course menu and loved it. Make sure to reserve.
Price certainly higher but quality is delivered 👍"
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"A fantastic evening with my family.
A superb restaurant.
The food was top notch. The waiter chose a red wine that was unbeatable. 
We had oysters, pasta dishes and pizza with truffle.
A very attentive staff made the visit extra good.
Will definitely come back next time we visit Berlin."
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"The food is TOP, a nice ambience! I highly recommend it. 
Service: 
- The gentlemen were nice, did a really good job. 
- The only woman working in the service is arrogant and unprofessional. Pretends she's nice and friendly, but when she doesn't like it, she acts like a little girl. It's gonna be pretty uncomfortable and bitchy.
The restaurant is of a high standard and the staff, in my opinion, must be of the same standard.
Unfortunately, this “nice” woman does not match the level."
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"We went back!
a first dinner, and a second two days later
pasta in the grindstone, sea bream with salt, are unavoidable.
It's not a pizzeria, it's better"
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,Extremely snooty staff. Very unfriendly and superficial. Misunderstands potential customers as the staff does not take questions seriously.
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Es tut mir leid zu hören, dass Sie eine negative Erfahrung mit dem Personal gemacht haben. Solche Situationen können sehr frustrierend sein, besonders wenn man sich als potenzieller Kunde nicht respektiert fühlt. Es könnte hilfreich sein, Ihr Feedback direkt an das Unternehmen zu richten, damit sie die Möglichkeit haben, ihre Servicequalität zu verbessern. Haben Sie vielleicht schon versucht, Ihre Erfahrungen dort zu teilen?"
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Great location, tasty food, friendly service. However, the music was much too loud. You couldn't exchange a reasonable word. Despite the note on the service, the music was again turned loud. Not pleasant and suitable for the location as well as clientele."
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Das klingt wirklich ärgerlich! Es ist schade, dass die laute Musik deine Erfahrung beeinträchtigt hat, obwohl sonst alles positiv war. Es ist wichtig, dass das Ambiente einer Location zur Klientel passt. Vielleicht könntest du dem Restaurantbesitzer noch einmal dein Feedback geben, damit sie in Zukunft die Lautstärke der Musik besser kontrollieren können."
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Our expectations of the restaurant were high, especially because we wanted to celebrate our anniversary there. Unfortunately, the evening turned out to be the only disappointment.
Starting with a chaotic reservation process to a disastrous service.

Even the reservation was difficult. After booking online, we called for confirmation and found that the reservation was not noted. We had to make reservations again by phone. But even upon our arrival there was again no reservation and we were put without comment at a tiny table next to the wine cabinets. I was also forced to first clear away several champagne stands stored under the table by myself in order to be able to sit at all.

The service continued the disappointing experience. While pouring the water, I discovered a deep red lipstick print on my glass. A clear sign of a lack of hygiene. But it got worse... When the wine was served, my partner was injured by a sharp-edged splinter on the wine glass. This was the point for me where I would have liked to end the evening. But in order not to ruin the anniversary completely, I decided to stay because my partner was very much looking forward to the truffle pasta.

Unfortunately, even the food could not save our mood. The truffle paste was completely cooked and only the sauce met expectations. Even the previously served white bread was rock hard and stale.

During the evening, we realized that we were not the only ones suffering from the poor service. At the next table we discovered another wine glass with a striking jump during the evening. When we pointed this out to the waitress, she reacted annoyed and replaced the glass with another DIRTY glass.

Conclusion: In a restaurant of this standard, cleanliness, professionalism and hospitality should come first. The many shortcomings and indifference of the staff made this evening a decidedly negative experience. In the face of all these grievances, all I have left is to award a star."
Bellucci,Berlin,4.4,"Es tut mir leid zu hören, dass Ihr Abend so enttäuschend war. Es ist besonders frustrierend, wenn man sich auf einen besonderen Anlass wie einen Jahrestag freut und dann mit solch schlechten Erfahrungen konfrontiert wird. Die Probleme, die Sie beschrieben haben – von der chaotischen Reservierung über die hygienischen Mängel bis hin zum unprofessionellen Service – sind in der Tat inakzeptabel, besonders in einem Restaurant, das einen höheren Anspruch erhebt.

Eine solche Erfahrung kann nicht nur den Abend ruinieren, sondern auch das gesamte Erlebnis eines Restaurants in Frage stellen. Es ist wichtig, dass Restaurants nicht nur auf das Essen, sondern auch auf den Service und die Atmosphäre achten, um den Gästen ein rundum positives Erlebnis zu bieten. Ihre Rückmeldung ist wertvoll und könnte dem Restaurant helfen, die notwendigen Verbesserungen vorzunehmen.

Ich hoffe, dass Sie in Zukunft bessere Restaurant-Erlebnisse haben werden und dass Ihr nächster Jahrestag unvergesslich wird – im positiven Sinne!"

The food was just great. Every meal was freshly prepared, tastefully balanced and beautifully arranged. You immediately notice that a lot of attention to detail and high-quality ingredients are used here. Especially the main course was a real highlight – perfectly prepared and taste unforgettable.

Ristorante Mjalt,Berlin,4.9,"...A leccare di ditte..👌🏻
Every dish starts with the irresistible aroma that then the seal of external taste with nothing /no other restaurant delicious from smell to super delicious taste. I recommend everyone who stops briefly in Berlin... will get a good taste of Italian food; but with a lot of love and respect prepared and served by the restaurant staff.... they feel really positive energy... there I was proud of the Albanians (always with good cooperation of the Italian staff🤌🏻avanti cosi 😊) who set foot all over the world, leaving traces that are not erased by any other Unique restaurant.... and my daughter was very satisfied 🙏🏻
...keep it up... 
Ps... the aroma meets the nose, so we forgot to take a photo first,... but immediately prepared the forks 🙈☺️👌🏻
Just let yourself be surprised!

Mille Grazie a Team Mjalti!

The Meat,Berlin,4.2,Fabulous restaurant who helped us celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary...The food was amazing and atmosphere too...
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"Exceptional hospitality paired with very tasty food. The atmosphere is really nice. I cannot think of anything bad to say, it is a place to go in Berlin!!"
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,Perfect place to eat great steaks. The food and service is excellent. Steak was cooked to perfection. We highly recommend this place.
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"A nice dinner, a stylish restaurant and good service.
Definitely worth a visit. We will come back."
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"A nice place with excellent meat and other dishes. There is also a wow effect.
The service was extremely friendly.
A point of criticism. The plates were not preheated, which unfortunately made the steak cold quickly"
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"The meat was great. 
Either grill yourself or have it prepared. 

The side dishes were very small and the sauces cold. 

The Service was overwhelmed with a 6-seater table. 
The drinks were taken incorrectly and delivered by 3 different people. 
It's a shame for the price you pay"
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"1A. Toller Service. Excellent food. Fully recommended. When I get back to Berlin, I will come back here."
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"Slow and disastrous Service
Two entrecotes of scarce 250gr each at the modest figure of 96€ practically 200€ per kg hurray
Salad of rocket and cherry tomatoes for two at the modest amount of 17€ ca ... hurray
You get up and you feel like you've been mugged..."
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,We came on our first night in Berlin and it didn’t disappoint! We were looking for really tasty food and got exactly that. Ordered 2 pulled pork burger and both were so tasty and priced so reasonably. Staff so friendly and very helpful. Will definitely be back!
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"If you order two 300gr file steaks,
you expect two file steaks to be served.
But if the steak leftovers are served and it is explained, in total that is 2x 300gr then it is fraud on the customer

By the way, the bill of course said “filet steak”"
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"Not a steakhouse, more a Turkish cantina. Pebersauce without taste, half cooked pommes. Not worth the money"
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"Not a steakhouse, more a Turkish cantina. Pebersauce without taste, half cooked pommes. Not worth the money at all…….."
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"A really negative experience ! I received a voucher from my colleagues for
 € 150,00 and this I could not redeem , because I did not have the checkout slip with me. ( A GIFT ! NO CHECKOUT NOTE )
We couldn't order with it."
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"We had an amazing experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely delicious. The service was outstanding as well; the staff was attentive, friendly, and made sure everything was perfect. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and excellent service. Will definitely be coming back!"
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"The restaurant concept seemed very special (like an event) and the prices were auspiciously high. Unfortunately, you felt like a guest in a train station restaurant. No real hospitality was felt. Order...food .. ready .. (all within an hour! All very hectic ! Too bad! Apparently, it should be sold quickly to be able to offer the table again. The dishes (grilled shrimp) and rump steak never had the stated weight, even if one assumes the gross weight. We had decided on the preparation in the kitchen. We could have roasted ourselves at the table. The rum steak was a thin piece of meat and came through instead of medium. According to the complaint, the meat was minimally thicker. Overall, the food was nothing special, but exorbitantly expensive! Overall, I would not recommend the restaurant."
The Meat,Berlin,4.2,"We went for a birthday whilst on a city break in Berlin. I wanted to book a good steak restaurant and searched on Trip Adviser. The reviews seemed good.

We didn’t realise it was a Turkish restaurant but that wasn’t really a problem. Good, attentive staff. Quick, rather rushed service. The major problem was the pricing. I didn’t see anywhere on the menu that the steaks are priced on weight. I ordered a 200g Argentinian fillet at €37. I was charged €60 when the bill came. Our bill for 2 adults and 2 teenagers came to €300. The food was average, the service was good but the price was ridiculous."

Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"Amazing place, under the subway tracks, fantastic food very charming environment, almost exclusively frequented by Berliners.
Absolutely recommended"
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"Beautiful German gem, see for your German brown cafe with traditional food. Food arrived quickly but very tasty! Great portions and friendly staff. Assortment of beers also huge."
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"We wanted to eat inside but we weren't allowed to. Everyone had to eat in the beer garden across the road. Smoking is allowed at all tables there. It is next to the railway and a busy road. So you can't eat outside nice and quiet. 
We didn't love the food. The salad was very bad. Dehydrated and brown edges on the lettuce. The pepper was very weak and you could bend it without it breaking.
I would not recommend this restaurant."
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"We stopped here after a beer at the beer garden where it was too late for food. I’m so glad we did. The food was fabulous, the portions huge and prices reasonable. They had great microbrew beers too. We may come come back to try the pork knuckles - they looked so meaty and the meat just fell from the bone. We had the spaetzle with bacon and the chicken cordon blue. Both great choices. I highly recommend!"
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"Charming local, carved under the railway near the Tiergarden stop. Few places available, better to book. Typical German pub setting, with shared tables. Maybe a little noisy but it's part of the local type. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Traditional dishes are served in some cases slightly revisited (usually presented as proposals of the day). Excellent quality and monstrous quantities. We tried duck, cheese spatzel and boulette. Great choice of beers. Prices below the city average: 62€ (tip excluded) for 3 large dishes (you ate at least four), 2 beers and water."
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"Great place 
Excellent food at a good price
Letter in Spanish 
Live music 
I ended up dancing on the track
Very funny 
If you don't want to wait too long for the food to be brought to you don't go to rush hour
I would certainly repeat"
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"Local beer and Schnitsell , very good, a traditional restaurant in Berlin for traditional German food"
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"If you take the northern exit from the platform, you land right next to the entrance to the spring. The ambience is quaint, the staff friendly and prudent. The local beer and food are delicious. In addition to the menu, there are also changing dishes. The portions are sufficient for normal hunger. A timely reservation is recommended. We will definitely come back."
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,Really lovely cosy restaurant. We had the Berlin Meatballs and the Game Goulash. Both were really tasty. Beers and service were also great. Traditional music was played for a donation.
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"A restaurant that doesn’t pay for a mine from outside but once you walk through the door. We discover a typical German tavern , very rustic , very warm welcome , simple cuisine but on homemade and gargantuan quantities a big thank you"
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,Very authentic atmosphere. We were made to feel very welcome and the children were even given a lollipop at the end. The food tastes good and the portions are massive! I’d definitely recommend pre-booking as it is very popular and difficult to find space in. Definitely worth the visit!
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"Cool pub/restaurant under the train tracks. Weather was not so great, so they were seating indoors. We were in the front room. The back room appeared to be a private party. Very crowded, communal tables. Popular with the locals. Lots of drink options, including extensive bottle beer options. Draft beer was from a local brewery, Lemke. This was fun because I have a friend named Lemke, took some coasters for him. I had the goulash with red cabbage and boiled potatoes. Wife had the meatballs with potato salad and a big pickle. Both were nice but my wife preferred to add my leftover sauce to her meatballs. The pickle was very good, especially with the meatball or with the potato salad. We finished with a brownie in vanilla sauce, served warm and quite tasty. Staff spoke English, and was helpful, despite the crowds. Service was reasonably quick. Menu had a nice selection, as well as a handful of specials. To drink I had a one of the standard Lemke beers, but I also tried a Berliner Weisse beer as well. This is Germany’s answer to the Belgian Lambic. The beer is naturally sour, so they temper that by adding fruit syrup, like raspberry or cherry. Another options is a herbal mixture, Woodruff. Hard to describe the last one, to me it is kind of minty. All are sweet. The sweet addition rounds out the sourness. Probably not for everyone, but if you like sour beers, I suggest you try it sometime. . While it may be “discovered” it is first a neighborhood place. Love that about it."
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"Not a good meal 
Unfortunately the schnitzel was terrible and the food took more than forever 
Very disappointing 
Also too expensive"
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"Great food and service. It was very busy, we had to wait a while for a table to become available. Tasty food, not expensive and large portions. Highly recommended."
Tiergarten-quelle,Berlin,4.4,"I can recommend this pub to all travelers to Berlin. The interior is old and worn out, which has a special charm. In addition, there is a very good menu with solid home cooking or bourgeois cuisine. From the Wiener Schnitzel to the Haxe you get everything you imagine under German cuisine. I always liked it and the portions are very large."

Aapka - Alexanderplatz,Berlin,4.8,We were really looking forward to our visit. Service was good but food was disappointingly bland and sadly a bit meh.
Aapka - Alexanderplatz,Berlin,4.8,Great restaurant! The service is very friendly and the atmosphere is very pleasant. The food was delicious too. Definitely a place worth coming back to.
Aapka - Alexanderplatz,Berlin,4.8,"Today I visited an Indian restaurant for the first time and I really liked it.
Very good service, delicious aromatic food and a pleasant atmosphere.
My first contact with Indian cuisine was all-round positive.
I will gladly come back and recommend it to others."

Aapka - Alexanderplatz,Berlin,4.8,Fantastic food and great service and value for money awesome. That's all Indian can do. The Naan is like original. Highly recommended
Aapka - Alexanderplatz,Berlin,4.8,"Very complete menu of dishes, servers of extreme sympathy, it was a really pleasant evening with six of our children.
Everything we chose in dishes was really delicious. We recommend for the quality of meals, quantity also.
Go ahead, you won't be disappointed!"
Aapka - Alexanderplatz,Berlin,4.8,"We ordered drinks, starters, and main courses, and in under 5 minutes our mains appeared which suggests to me that the curries are not freshly prepared. While the food itself was average, we never received our starters & dips. When a server asked if we had enjoyed our meal, the missing starters still had not been addressed. We were charged for all the food and when I pointed out that we had not received items, the server looked confused instead of apologetic!!
The service is disorganised and rushed, with too many tables crammed into the space. The experience felt more like buffet-style dining; eat quickly and move on, lacking attention to detail. In my view this restaurant is highly overrated."
Aapka - Alexanderplatz,Berlin,4.8,"Great Indian food. We both chose for a change to vegetarians option with Channa and Jalfrezi vegetables curry, massive flavour from each. The chick peas in the Channa worked so well. Very impressed with the before and after flavours tasted. Each dish came with a steaming hot basmati rice. Very well recommended, to visit this restaurant."

My number in what's app is 573104626797 Thanks in advance."
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"A really fun and delicious restaurant with an interesting menu that will not disappoint, great ambience . We unfortunately had eaten a very large brunch that day but we pushed through …. Wine was also very good."
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"Dear Pantry team, I want to thank you again for the warm welcome, great service, yummy menu and lovely atmosphere in your restaurant for the occasion of my husband's birthday. My husband was blown away and you really made us happy. If we come back to Berlin, we will definately visit your restaurant again and for sure we will recommand this to our friends and family whenever they will visit Berlin. My warmest and deepest THANK YOU !!! Take care, love Mieke"
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"We were on a Sunday night there not many guests understandable. The choice of food very good, we found the food very good and the portions were rather large 
We came to this place based on a recommendation and will come back (are we in Berlin again...)"
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"We were a small group and came on recommendation. Great atmosphere, stylishly decorated, good menu/dishes, great Service (competent, humorous, devoted): we felt very comfortable. Thank you."
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"Elegant restaurant with ethnic grafts to Teutonic cuisine. Despite the ambition, the meat is not exceptional or served in an original way. Potatoes tasteless enough. Good chocolate dessert without overdoing it. In general a bit of a disappointment."
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"Good energy, excellent food, good drinks, what’s not to like. We were surprised how good the food actually were. When ordering a good steak, and you concentrate more on the side dishes, you know it’s all good."
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"We had a great time in Berlin and I was so glad that a friend gave me the name of Pantry. This is a great restaurant to have a nice eventing with friends of family. The food was delicious, the wine tasted great and the service was very nice with a big smile. We had the beef tataki (I love ponzu), salmon tataki, risotto and the burgers and the were yummy!"
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"Pantry was a delight from start to finish. The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff were wonderfully friendly and full of positive energy. The atmosphere is stunning, especially in the backyard seating area which feels like a hidden oasis in the city. Highly recommend for a relaxed and memorable meal."
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"Due to the good weather, the catering took place in the attractively designed backyard. Apart from the fact that there was nothing wrong with the choice of food and the quality and the spicy homemade bread gave an idea of the successful evening in front, it must be emphasized that the service and hospitality were absolutely exceptional. We have not experienced such attentive service and friendly and humorous service for a long time, apart from visits to the absolute top gastronomy, as we did during our visit to the Pantry. We had the feeling of being welcomed to friends. Too bad we don't live in Berlin. We would definitely be regulars here. Thanks again for the wonderful evening. Next time we are in Berlin, we will see you again!"
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"We had reserved and got a nice quiet table. The food was fancy and good. The service, too. However, a Coke 0.2 for 5 EUR is really a proud price."

The pantry really has its own flair, very warm and with a feel-good character. The whole staff very friendly and also equipped with a decent dose of humor. The food very fine and perfectly arranged and also brought to the guest. The Patntry stands for perfect gastronomy from food to service and always a recommendation. On leaving the location we were accompanied to the exit which confirmed the positive overall picture again. Thank you for a great time. Axel Strothmann & family"
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"I was with friends yesterday at Panty Restaurant in Mitte.
First: pleasant atmosphere, first-class service, a culinary highlight that delights
The innovative dishes with European and Asian influences are finely tasted, lovingly arranged on the plate and used with a nice saying of the service.
We enjoyed the following:
Fresh oysters
Mussel in spicy white wine orange broth
Beef Tataki with wild herb salad
Turbot
Steak Florentine
the digestif of espresso and and and I forgot, but was super
Dinner accompanied by a
excellent Pinot Blanc

I will gladly come back and can recommend the “pub”."
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,What a find! Happened upon this restaurant and lucky to get a table on a Friday night. Great food and service. Loved the ambiance. Very friendly staff. We had fillet steak and tuna steak. Both superb as were the veg. We’ll be back if possible.
Pantry,Berlin,4.3,"Addendanace at arrival was excellent and also service during the dinner.
Starters with Chardonnay White wine were good.
Not happy at all with the steak filet, which was the most expencive main disc, not tender and lots of fat.
We could eat only half of the steak."

A very good Indian restaurant with a varied choice of dishes.
The dishes were well seasoned, the rice was perfectly cooked.
The service was impeccable and with little care!
Digestive offered!!
I recommend 100%
Thank you very much."

Haveli,Berlin,4.7,"Exceptional Indian cuisine & warm hospitality at Haveli in Berlin

I recently visited the Haveli in Berlin and was thrilled from the first moment. The warm welcome and welcoming atmosphere made me feel at home immediately. The Haveli team obviously puts a lot of passion into their work.

Haveli,Berlin,4.7,"In 1963, Schöneberg was the center of the political west, inspiring John F. Kennedy to choose this area to famously announce, ""Ich bin ein Berliner."" Times may have changed, but modern-day Schöneberg still pays tribute to its historical legacies. Once the richest city outside of Berlin proper, the area's affluent past is still visible in ornate housing facades dating back to the Gründerzeit of the 19th century, while residents in fur coats walking their dogs or shopping in high-end KaDeWe continue the tradition with a modern flair. Schöneberg was also once the center of the decadent and burlesque nightlife of the 1920s. It was here that Marlene Dietrich partied with Christopher Isherwood and the first gay bar in Germany was founded. Today, the gay community still revolves around Nollendorfplatz. The overground Ubahn station is even illuminated in rainbow colors, paying tribute to Schöneberg's progressive past."

Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,Food was amazing. Very friendly staff and great service. The restaurant was busy and had a good atmosphere. Would definitely return.
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"A party of 6, excellent service and food: first restaurant we experience in Berlin with friendly staff and they went above and beyond for us with some awkward food requests. 
Great meats, will definitely return."
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"From some research we chose this restaurant to spend the first evening in Berlin. 
Remarkable customer attention, good food. I got a really good bream and my husband tasted the schnitzel. 
Quality price good! The only flaw is the ""excessive"" cost of water.
I recommend it!!"
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,Excellent family run restaurant with a lovely cosy atmosphere. The steak burger was one of the best my wife has ever had. Our female waitress was excellent and very attentive despite the language barrier. Definitely recommend.
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"Don’t be put off by the slightly underwhelming exterior - the restaurant is beautiful inside,"
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"5 minute walk from the holiday inn express, or Potsdamer platz - and what a hidden gem this is. The food is exceptional - meat is super high quality and perfectly cooked and presented. It’s a chilled out, no rush, well run restaurant with great staff and a lovely ambiance."
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"This time much better experience, because by experience better ordered (last visit 2024 was rather a disappointing dry aged for an exaggerated price with rather (then) mediocrity...) ...this time the flambéed chorizo - a must - the entrecote very well fried - not top of the line, but good steakhouse - gladly again"
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"A sad and boring steak, but an incompetent sauce. The service was not present and no one came to the table to hear if the food was ok. Stay away."
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"Tender and cooked on point ! Chimichurri added a great flavor .
Service was perfection! Thank you Pablo 
Tasty sides ! We will be back"
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,What an amazing restaurant the food is fantastic and the service is brilliant. We visited for my mums birthday today and they made such a fuss of her even bringing out a desert with a sparkler in. You really made her day thank you. We are visiting from the UK and will definitely recommend to our friends if they are ever visiting Berlin.
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"Amazing steak and great service. Had filet, sirloin and rib eye all amazing. I am fussy around steak and it was one of the best. Burger was fantastic too. Staff are so accommodating. Bread and garlic butter was to die for. Wine was great too. A must try."
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"We went to Asador for my partners birthday, whilst on a trip to Berlin from the UK. I had booked Asador purely on the reviews on trip advisor and I’m so glad I trusted those reviews and great trip advisor score! 

We go out for steak for pretty much every birthday, and I booked Asador months ago when I booked the trip to Berlin.

When we got to Asador, we were greeted by friendly staff and were immediately offered drinks and bread with a lovely garlic butter. 

We both had ribeye steaks that were cooked to absolute perfection (medium rare) as well as grilled vegetables, my partner had fries and I had rosemary potatoes and we both had bearnaise sauce. I couldn’t fault one single thing about the meal, it was delicious! 

When I made the booking, I’d added a note to say it was my partners birthday, sometimes when you go to places and they’re busy, these notes tend to get missed but not at Asador, they had seen the note, and when my partner asked for the dessert menu, a lovely and attentive member of staff (who’s name I’m sorry we didn’t ask for!) went off and came back with dessert and a sparkler. He sung happy birthday to my partner and showed us that he cared and wanted to make the effort. 

To end our meal, he gave us some limoncello, and then asked if we wanted more, as I don’t really drink, I said no and then he asked if we’d tried Berliner luft (a popular peppermint liqueur in Germany we’re told) and brought some over for us to try (this is so nice if you are reading and haven’t tried!) 

As I said, I really can’t fault our experience at Asador and would recommend to anyone looking for a lovely restaurant for any occasion! (Even just for a weekday dinner). We even said if this was a local restaurant to us at home, we’d regularly return. 

Thank you so much to the kind member of staff this evening and to all the other staff for making it an all round perfect evening."
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,The food here is ok. My pork was overcooked and therefore dry. The service was ok and pleasant. The wine and beer were ok. Not a five star restaurant.
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"Great steaks, food was amazing. Beer was good too. Only thing that we didnt like was the waiter/server had already added 10% to the bill. Not sure if this is because we where tourists or is the normal thing restaurants do in Berlin."
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,"Great food really nice staff o a good Rioja wine
World-class meat 
A must if you like meat and are in Berlin
❤️❤️❤️"
Steakhouse ASADOR,Berlin,4.3,A bit boring environment. Low Service. We had an appetizer burrata but only tasted mozzarella and it was ice cold so did not taste good at all. The beef was good with good fries and good gratin. The waiter asks if we want to tip it gets uncomfortable when we don't really understand and says the amount he gets sad so we say well okay but we can tip 5% so he kind of gets mad and says do as you want so then they feel ungrateful so we pay the bill and go. We don't even get a bye when they took offense

Häppies,Berlin,4.8,Such a nice idea for a café and the selection of Germknodel so diverse. We ordered once sweet and once savoury. Both variations tasted extremely delicious. A clear recommendation and gladly again
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,Innovative and super taste in everything we got. Very interesting concept
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"Is there anything better than being so positively surprised about some food that you get the desire for a adopt the concept. Very innovative and exciting food, always nice to experience something you've never had before"
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"We didn't know what it was, and we still don't know about it, a bowl/ maybe pasta dough, steamed, probably not baked, it was soft and delicious with super fill. Nice service, fast serving, extremely reasonable price, the salad was also really nice. I mean a glass of red wine had done wonders, my caffe latte, didn't really fit, next time I buy water. The coffee was really good, but should have been dessert, and not for my goat cheese knödel."
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"Cute little and loving shop whose name is program. The food is impeccable, makes you happy because fluffy and delicious. The care is wonderful, very attentive-it doesn't get better. Come back. Thanks for the wonderful lunch."
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,Happened by this restaurant and decided to give dumplings a try. These are stuffed with various veggy concotions and nicely served up with an accompanying sauce - so nicely presented. We three had different dishes and tasted each other's meal and declared all to be delicious. A must when we're back in Berlin.
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"Like many others who've written reviews, we were surprised to find that steamed buns (bao) are very tasty. We guzzled savory buns with walnut and with chipotle filling, followed by a honey bun with poppy seeds (we shared). The dressings were excellent and despite the smallish size, we were happily filled up. The two young women serving seemed to do an excellent job. There's lots of light and space in the resto, which also has a wall decorated with buns. Get happy!"
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"As not a big fan of dumplings- i was a bit scared going to have a meal here. But- when i saw the place, big smiles, nice flowers- all was good. And then- the menu!!! So small, but also- enough for everyone. Drinks, sweet and salty versions of dumplings. Awesome experience and nice lunch."
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"Häppies is a restaurant in Berlin that serves steamed buns with unique fillings, both savory and sweet. Reviewers rave about the food and service, especially recommending the dumplings with blue cheese and pear or lentils."
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"Spacious new location where it is now a little easier to get a seat and only a stone's throw away from the old shop :) 
Häppies are and will remain the best yeast dumplings I have ever eaten in my life. Made with passion and you can taste it.

So nice that Häppies is finally back. 2023 was just missing something without you."
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"We were introduced to Happies by a food tour guide. Wonderfully unique, like nothing we’ve ever eaten before. Sort of a steamed Asian Bao bun filled with savory (or sweet) fillings, topped with a variety of nuts, berries, and/or sauces. So good in fact that we returned the following day for lunch on our own. Add to the quality of the food the love and attention of the staff and owner. This place is simply brilliant, and “Happy”"
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"We absolutely love Häppies.
This was our 4th visit at this tiny little place - and a ""must-visit"" whenever we are i Berlin.
The germknödels are just perfect, tasty and beautiful - and the owner and her staff are so friendly and altogether lovely people.
A trip to berlin without a Häppies is just not right - so we will se you again somewhere in Berlin"
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"Denoted in Prenzlauer Berg by a couple outside tables and their Zoloft-reminiscent mascot häppies exudes joy in the form of creative globally-inspired Dumplings served at fair prices from a gracious staff.

Not the Germknödeln of old, though a Dessert Bun named “Netti” puts Spiced Plum and Austrian Poppyseeds front and center in Brown Butter, häppies offerings are all Vegetarian and served with Salad with one enough for a snack and two plenty for most as a meal.

Prone to weekend sell-outs of top items, though pre-orders and take-out are available, it is amidst clean white surroundings that diners huddle over Coffee or Housemade Lemonade while digging into flavors like “Mathias” Soy, Figs and Chilies or the Lentil-loaded “Krische” served with Chutney, Yogurt and Papadam.

€7,00 to €8,50 apiece, not “cheap” but quite affordable considering portions and products involved, youngsters are invited to indulge in Pizza-riffing Julia that can be upgraded by Pesto while everyone would be wise to order one of owner Uli Marschner’s “Dani” that dazzles like Strawberry Shortcake infused with Peppercorns and a hint of acidity from aged Balsamic."
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,We were part of a well known food tour and had reserved a full table. My wife speaks no German but all the staff could communicate in English and were attentive. Our dumplings arrived fast and we loved the blue cheese dumplings. Reasonably priced and highly recommended.
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"1 kind of dish... infinite possibilities, very unique combinations from cuisines all around the world, super sweet service and please don't pass on the funky lemonade... it will get you somewhat happy and high ;))"
Häppies,Berlin,4.8,"What a find - thanks to TripAdvisor for the recommendation. A bit of a walk from the centre but a very pleasant one taking you through the lovely Prenzlauer Berg. 

It's a tiny cafe with a very warm welcome, lovely flowers and fun cartoons on the walls, serving variations on the same theme - Austrian yeast dumplings, with different savoury and sweet fillings. We had one with kimchi and another with spicy lentils and chutney, and had to leave room for the sweet ones - the Netti, with stewed plums, poppy seeds and brown butter was one of the nicest things I have ever eaten. 

Drinks were also lovely and staff could not have been lovelier.b"

Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"Could you tell me if the closing time is really 10pm and if so, is the last bookable time or kicking out time please? TIA"
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"I celebrated my birthday with a group of friends and relatives at Restaurant Ebert on January 20, 2026. 

The four-course menu was excellent. Everyone was thrilled. The service was perfect, especially Mrs. Ebert was a very nice hostess and responded to all wishes. Even the normal opening hours were exceeded, because on January 21st it was my sister's birthday.

I can only recommend the restaurant. The next time we visit Berlin we will be happy to come back."
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"What a great place! Super nice and attentive staff, great food and excellent atmosphere in a quiet suburb of Berlin. Do not miss out if you are in Berlin."
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"here everything is just right - the food a revelation, the ambience just pleasant and the service as always great - today was my birthday dinner here once again and I couldn't ask for a nicer gift. thanks to the Ebert with his entire crew :-) Christine"
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"I come to the Ebert very often with business partners, friends and family and everyone is enthusiastic - it's just a safe address for best food and good service - here the price-performance quality is right - not so often found in Berlin at the moment!

Thanks to the Ebert team!"
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"Like every year, I went out to eat gas with a friend. Due to positive reviews we ended up in the Ebert. The corner restaurant is ""neat"" with adequate table linen. The placement took despite reservation. The service is superficially friendly. Now to the goose. The roast goose is no bargain at 44 euros. You get asked chest or club. A table must share half a goose. I had helped decide for the club. A leg smaller than a chicken leg was then served. I'd never seen anything like it. Next to it was a rag with skin. The meat was moderate. Due to the small club tough, the flesh of the rag difficult. When roasting goose, you look forward to crispy skin. That's what we searched for in vain. The announced apple with cranberries was cold and hard. Then it became unfortunate. Contact with service. He told us that the apple was just decoration and had always been served cold for 37 years. Aha, how the restaurant then makes it into the recommendations is unclear. The service had further denied that the club was unusually small. Otherwise they wouldn't have been extradited, Aha. The customer is presented as a moron, you shouldn't do that. The side dishes clove and herb were ok. Overall, we will visit another restaurant next year. I wonder what happened to top-class gastronomy. Unfortunately, only the price is right."
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,Service and food were not special and too expensive what was offered. Tortellini tasted of garlic and portion was moderate. Zurich squirreled was nothing special either. Röstli wasn't fried through.
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"We were again in the restaurant Ebert. While previous visits did not give rise to complaints, this time it was the opposite.
We had plaice with fried potatoes and veal schnitzel with asparagus.The fried potatoes soft and cardboard the plaice very thin, consisted mainly of breadcrumbs.
The asparagus should have been in the boiling water for a few minutes longer, so the asparagus was still too hard, could hardly be cut with the blunt knife. It also lacked the pinch of sugar; which is actually added to the boiling water. The two small, thin veal chips lacked the spice, tasted bland. Cranberries would have done the meat good. To mention the price of veal cutlets with Beelitzer asparagus: 41,00 Euro !
We haven't eaten so badly in a long time."
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"Attractive atmosphere, nice service. Starter: Potato soup, totally in the style of homemaker kind. So far ok, but the price of 10 euros is more spiced than the soup and lacks a little taste kick.
The starter ""Bried Blood Sausage"" is spiced up to the main course for a fair 25 euros. My question about mustard darkens the face of the waitress. ""Good sauce,"" she says, ""just try it like that."" Yes, sir. Mustard is not necessary. I would have brought it anyway.
A disappointment the marzipan cream brulée. A little blob of cold cream. My objection, that it is precisely the combination of warm caramel layer and unheated cream that makes the appeal, is blown away: The chef would go over the shift with the Bunsen burner before it was sent. This shift here has never seen a burner! However, the sour cherries, whose raison d’être is not completely obvious to me, are boiling hot. Maybe the chef just slipped?
Bottom line: good. Good enough to come back? I don't know yet."
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,What a find. Family owned and run. Very friendly with great food. We went Sunday night which was a special Italian night alongside the usual menu. Excellent value. Would definitely go again.
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"Situated a bit away from the hustle and bustle of a residential district, our discovery of the day is “hiding”: 
very nice and attentive staff, a small, fine menu that was supplemented by an Austrian special menu and a kitchen that knows how to do it! 
Ebert’s is on our favourites list for Berlin!"
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"For a tourist, it might be an upscale German restaurant, but we were disappointed by the not outstanding food nor service. Look further, you will find better places elsewhere."
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,One of the best Culinary evenings ever! Go to Ebert’s family run for 40 years and totally amazing!
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"Just home from an absolutely fantastic evening. The food, recipes from Mr Wannermacher ( had a michelin star for many years) was beautifully prepared, cooked, presented and served. The Salmon in the Starter had a consistence I have never had before, it was delicious. The Lobster Bisque was the best I have ever had, I could have bathed in it! Flank steak excellent and the desert was a mixture of the best chocolate moise and passion fruit gel and semi fredo, a perfect balance of two tastes. Thank you for this wonderful experience!"
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"A great restaurant, very cozy, great dishes, great quality.
I highly recommend it. We will definitely come back!"
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"This is what you expect from a contemporary German food.

Food is very nice, service is flawless, atmosphere very familiar.

Pan fried pikeperch with pan fried potatoes was just too much fried combination. 

Otherwise only recommendation!"
Ebert Restaurant & Bar,Berlin,4.6,"The service was nice and accommodating, especially given the restaurant staffed to the last table. Unfortunately, the quality of the food dropped significantly. We ate martinsgans menu. The foie gras pie was very tasty, the vegetable broth that followed unfortunately only lukewarm. The goose was very bad, because of the sauce already prepared on the plate it was not very crusty, the knives were unfortunately not sharp enough, so the division was very difficult. Red cabbage and kale were acceptable, so were dumplings. All in all acceptable, but not a great experience, which hurts in the face of great demand. In addition, the noise level was very high, so talking about the table was almost impossible, but we were there for dinner as well😄. Perhaps our expectations were too high, as we had assumed the Other level of the restaurant."

Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,Wie weit ist der Admiralspalast entfernt? Zu fuß Danke Lydia 017660863455
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"Always love coming here when in Berlin, traditional German pub. Great menu, delicious German food, great beer, wonderful interior, ambiance and atmosphere (can get lively), and not forgetting the friendly polite service. To avoid being disappointed book in advance, it’s a great place."
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,Excellent value for money. Great atmosphere. Good standard of typical Berlin cuisine - even German-. Excellent deal. Very good ambient music. The crook and the Wiener Schnitzel really excellent. The best I've ever tasted in Germany.
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"What a quaint pub!
The staff with heart in the right place, plus the typical “Berlin muzzle”. 
The food was delicious, who likes it hearty, is absolutely right here!"
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"A nice Welcoming and a good table for a small and atypical establishment in this very impersonal neighborhood. At the hotel right next door, I enjoyed being able to find a personal place and away from ""groups""."
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"Visited on our first evening after a seven hour train journey from Gdansk.

Arrived at 7pm and the few tables outside were taken but we had a table inside next to the open window looking onto the street.

For our first visit to Germany what else could we try but currywurst - and it was really enjoyable."
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"Very good restaurant with German cuisine. The dishes are excellent and very hearty. It offers a wide range of German beers.

I recommend this restaurant!"
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"A real original what the Berliner Schnauze has with a lot of heart.

Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,What a great place. So much so that we went twice. Very friendly staff. Great traditional food and a fine array of beers.great place
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,We were looking for traditional german restaurant and we found this. It is a german pub that served authentic german food and alcohol. We had a Berliner pilsner beer and a currywurst to eat. The place seems pretty touristic but food seems authentic.
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"On my way to the ATM I passed this restaurant (it’s a block from hotel chateau Royal) and I saw a guy eating the schnitzel. My mouth immediately started to water. The next night, I insisted that we go there for dinner. We were not disappointed!

Hubby had the schnitzel (it was better than it looked) with creamed mushrooms, fried potatoes and sauerkraut. I had the bratwurst with mashed potatoes, gravy and sauerkraut. The schnitzel was crispy on the outside and oh so tender on the inside. The creamed mushrooms and fried potatoes were good I’m assuming (I didn’t have a bite). The brats were amazing—-and considering I was raised in them in WI that compliment is hard to give. They were juicy and sliced just right. The mashed potatoes and gravy were out of this world—I don’t eat them often but I almost cleaned the plate (and portions were ample)

I’m devoting an entire paragraph to the sauerkraut. I love the stuff we get in the US—usually I buy a high end German specialty brand in a jar. HOWEVER…the Poles and Germans do something different (and very special) with their sauerkraut here in Eastern Europe. First of all it has carrots in it. Secondly it isn’t as tangy as what we get in the states. It’s almost creamy. The Poles put very finely minced sausage in theirs. Anyway….IT IS DEVINE. we bought a polish cookbook just to try to replicate it! We don’t get home for 3 more weeks. Hope my tastebuds remember the flavor when we get home to AZ (not that I’ll be rushing to make sauerkraut and brats when it’s 110!!)

Anyway…do what you can to eat at this place. Foods is amazing. So are the beers and service!!!

We returned tonight and had small plates. Fried meatball for me (with sauerkraut of course) and hubby had two sausages (one bologna and one something else) and a meatball. Both were amazing as always. We’re here two more nights. If we go back…I’m totem between the schnitzel and the brats!!!"
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"Those who like solid home cooking and a well-kept Pilsener on tap are in good hands here and will not be disappointed. The host is friendly. International audience due to the central location.

The Berlin meeting point is a recommendation."
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"Very friendly welcome, the room is nice and you can also eat out. The menu offers various meat, poultry, fish, vegetarian dishes. Order taking and service are fast. The staff is very attentive. Plates are hearty, good and well presented. The wine is good. Beers, too. I recommend currywurst and herring fillets. Vegetables are delicious and potatoes are very well cooked. Do not hesitate to enjoy a kummel berliner at the end of the meal. It's delicious. I have been there twice in three days Very reasonable prices in this tourist area. I recommend."
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"Unfriendly Auntie. The Pepsi Max that no longer contained carbonation was considered ordinary. The young lady behind the bar tried to make this right. Nevertheless, not recommended."
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"Delicious food and great beer in a cozy setting. The schnitzel (fried pork cutlet with corn flakes) is highly recommended, and the apple strudel is outstanding."
Treffpunkt Berlin,Berlin,4.3,"Excellent German pub with a great range of beer. Fit us in without reservation. Very authentic German menu, somewhat limited range of foods. We ordered a pork knuckle each - it took longer than the 30 minutes advertised but was worth the wait! Shame the portion was so large, we probably could’ve shared one to prevent wastage but it was delicious. Absolutely recommend."
